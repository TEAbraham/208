  "question_text": "Julissa conducted a one-sample $t$-test for a population mean using a one-sided greater than hypothesis. Later, she realized that the value she had used for the standard error was incorrect and that the actual value that she should have used was higher.<br>Assuming everything else remains constant, what effect will the higher standard error have on the $t$-statistic and the $p$-value for the test?",
