  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Two large candy companies produce Halloween assortment bags which contain Cutsie Rolls as one of the candies in the bags.  A firm did a verified study sampling these candy bags from each company and counting the number of Cutsie Rolls contained.  It found that Company A had an average of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$15$</span> Cutsie Rolls per bag while Company B had an average of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$18$</span> Cutsie Rolls per bag.  If a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$95\\%$</span> confidence interval of the difference of these two means had a margin of error of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2.54$</span>, would you agree that Company B really had more Cutsie Rolls in its Halloween bags?</div>",
