  "question_text": "Two large candy companies produce Halloween assortment bags which contain Cutsie Rolls as one of the candies in the bags.  A firm did a verified study sampling these candy bags from each company and counting the number of Cutsie Rolls contained.  It found that Company A had an average of $15$ Cutsie Rolls per bag while Company B had an average of $18$ Cutsie Rolls per bag.  If a $95\\%$ confidence interval of the difference of these two means had a margin of error of $2.54$ , would you agree that Company B really had more Cutsie Rolls in its Halloween bags?",
