  "question_text": "According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average total tuition, fees, room and board at 4-year colleges and universities was $$24{,}706$ in 2013-2014. Mr. Nye believes the average is now higher.\nTo investigate, he randomly selects one 4-year school from each of the 50 states. He finds the sample average to be $$25{,}322$ and the sample standard deviation to be $$2{,}375$. There are no outliers in his data.\nDoes his data provide evidence at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level that the average total tuition, fees, room and board at 4-year colleges has increased?",

      "letter": "A",
      "text": "No, the $p$-value for the appropriate significance test is $0.07$. Since $0.07 > 0.05$, we do not have sufficient evidence at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level."

    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "No, the sample average is only $$616$ more than the 2013-2014 value. Considering that costs are more than $$20,000$, this is really not that much money."
    },
    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Yes, the $p$-value for the appropriate significance test is $0.04$, so we have strong evidence to suggest that the cost has increased."

    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "Yes, the sample average represents a $2.5\\%$ increase over the 2013-2014 costs. Since this is less than $5\\%$, our results are statistically significant at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level."
