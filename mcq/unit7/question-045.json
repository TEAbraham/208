  "question_text": "According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the average total tuition, fees, room and board at 4-year colleges and universities was $ $24{,}706$ in 2013-2014. Mr. Nye believes the average is now higher. To investigate, he randomly selects one 4-year school from each of the 50 states. He finds the sample average to be $ $25{,}322$ and the sample standard deviation to be $ $2{,}375$ . There are no outliers in his data. Does his data provide evidence at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level that the average total tuition, fees, room and board at 4-year​ colleges has increased?",

      "text": "No, the sample average is only $ 616 616 more than the 2013-2014 value. Considering that costs are more than $ 20 , 000 20 , 000 , this is really not that much money."

    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Yes, the p p -value for the appropriate significance test is 0.04 0.04 , so we have strong evidence to suggest that the cost has increased."

      "text": "Yes, the sample average represents a 2.5 % 2.5 % increase over the 2013-2014 costs. Since this is less than 5 % 5 % , our results are statistically significant at the α = 0.05 α = 0.05 level."
