  "question_text": "Fifth grader Scott is studying the heights of American women for a science fair project. Scott’s teacher told him that the heights of American females are normally distributed with the population standard deviation of $2.4\\text{ inches}$ , but he cannot remember the value for the mean. Scott’s older brother suggests that he estimate the unknown mean by calculating a confidence interval using data that Scott has collected for the heights of four women, as follows: $63 \\text{ inches}$ $69\\text{ inches}$ $62\\text{ inches}$ $66\\text{ inches}$ Based on this, Scott’s $99\\%$ confidence interval would be:",
