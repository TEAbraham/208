  "question_text": "Granny Green owned a huge farm and grew thousands of pea plants.  She read that there are $5$ or $6$ peas in a pod on average and she was sure her pods contained more peas than that.  She randomly sampled $40$ of her pea pods and decided to do a one-sample t-test to show that the mean number of peas in her pods were higher than the claimed average. The answer choices below contain both the alternative hypothesis for her test as well as a statement about the condition(s) she needs to verify.  Four of the answers contain something wrong, only one answer is correct.  Which one?",
