She read that there are <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> or <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$6$</span> peas in a pod on average and she was sure her pods contained more peas than that.  She randomly sampled <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> of her pea pods and decided to do a one-sample t-test to show that the mean number of peas in her pods were higher than the claimed average.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">The answer choices below contain both the alternative hypothesis for her test as well as a statement about the condition(s) she needs to verify.  Four of the answers contain something wrong, only one answer is correct.  Which one?</div>",
