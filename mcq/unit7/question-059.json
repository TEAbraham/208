  "question_text": "Granny Green owned a huge farm and grew thousands of pea plants. She read that there are $5$ or $6$ peas in a pod on average and she was sure her pods contained more peas than that. She randomly sampled $40$ of her pea pods and decided to do a one-sample t-test to show that the mean number of peas in her pods were higher than the claimed average.<br>The answer choices below contain both the alternative hypothesis for her test as well as a statement about the condition(s) she needs to verify. Four of the answers contain something wrong, only one answer is correct. Which one?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nFirst, the alternative hypothesis needs to state that Granny Green believes her peas would have greater than $6$ peas in a pod. Because she is using a one-sample t-test for a mean, she would need to use the population parameter, $\\mu$, in her hypothesis; it would be written as $H_{a}: \\mu>6$.\n\nTo verify conditions two general topics must be addressed: checking for independence and checking for an approximation of normality for the sampling distribution of $\\bar{x}$.\n\nTo check for independence Granny G. must sample randomly, which it says she did, and she must choose a sample which is at least $10$ times greater in size than her sample. Since her sample is $40$, and since she has thousands of pea plants, then this condition is met.\n\nTo check for an approximation of normality for the sampling distribution of $\\bar{x}$, Granny Green simply must have a sample size greater than $30$, which she does. So, this condition is also met.\n\nSo, Choice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because, though $H_{a}$ is correct, Granny G. did meet the conditions for independence.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because, though the statement about conditions is correct, $H_{a}$ is not because it uses a $p$ instead of a $\\mu$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because, though $H_{a}$ is correct, Granny G. did meet the conditions for showing that the sampling distribution was approximately normal.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because, though the statement about conditions is correct, $H_{a}$ is not because it uses an $ \\bar{x}$ instead of a $\\mu$.",
