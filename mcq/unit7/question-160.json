His manager told him that he wanted to statistically show that the new lights last longer so that they can be advertised that way.  Fortunately, the company has a machine that can hasten the life of the bulbs so it would not take Nicky a very long time to measure their lifespans. He was told to test <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$25$</span> random light bulbs of each type. Which of the following is the best statistical method to try to show that the new light bulbs last significantly longer than the old light bulbs?</div>",
