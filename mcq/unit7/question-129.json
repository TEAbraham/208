  "solution": "Statement I is true; the samples must be independent and random.\n\nStatement II is true; the sampling distribution of the difference must be approximately normal. This is achieved when either the populations are approximately normal or the combined sample sizes are over $30$.\n\nStatement III is false; while large samples are optimal, they are not a necessary condition.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
