  "question_text": "The Durabell Battery company was concerned about the life of its EE battery. In the past, the EE battery had a mean life span of $34$ hours, but the company was concerned that the battery life had decreased. It took a random sample of $40$ batteries from its assembly plant and tested them. The mean life span was $33.4$ hours with a standard deviation of $2.4$ hours.\nUsing a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$, which of the following is an appropriate conclusion of a one-sample $t$-test for the population mean of the EE battery?",

    {
      "letter": "A",
      "text": "Clearly, the new mean battery life has decreased from $34$ to $33.4$ hours. Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis and show that the EE battery life has decreased."
    },
    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "Because we obtain a $p$-value of $0.94$, which is greater than our significance level of $0.05$, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Thus, we do not have enough evidence to show that the mean EE battery life has decreased."
    },
    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Because we obtain a $p$-value of $0.06$, which is greater than our significance level of $0.05$, we must reject the null hypothesis. Thus, we have enough evidence to show that the mean EE battery life has decreased."

    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "Because we obtain a $p$-value of $0.12$, which is greater than our significance level of $0.05$, we cannot reject the null hypothesis. Thus, we do not have enough evidence to show that the mean EE battery life has decreased."
