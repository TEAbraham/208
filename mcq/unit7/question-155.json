  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">The Durabell Battery company was concerned about the life of its EE battery.  In the past, the EE battery had a mean life span of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$34$</span> hours, but the company was concerned that the battery life had decreased.  It took a random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> batteries from its assembly plant and tested them.  The mean life span was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$33.4$</span> hours with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2.4$</span> hours.  Using a significance level of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\alpha=0.05$</span>, which of the following is an appropriate conclusion of a one-sample <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$t$</span>-test for the population mean of the EE battery?</div>",
