  "solution": "Canadian adults and American adults represent two separate populations and we are interesting in comparing means. A two-sided $t$-test is appropriate with the following hypotheses:\n\n$${ H }_{ 0 }: { \\mu }_{ C } = { \\mu }_{ A }$$\n\n$${ H }_{ a }: { \\mu }_{ C } > { \\mu }_{ A }$$\n\nWhere ${ \\mu }_{ C }$ is the mean number of countries that Canadian adults can identify and ${ \\mu }_{ A }$ is the mean number of countries that American adults can identify. We are told that we can assume all conditions of the test to be satisfied, so we proceed to calculating the $t$-statistic.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n$$t = \\dfrac { \\overline { { x }_{ 1 } } - \\overline { { x }_{ 2 } } }{ \\sqrt { \\dfrac { { s }_{ 1 }^{ 2 } }{ { n }_{ 1 } } + \\dfrac { { s }_{ 2 }^{ 2 } }{ { n }_{ 2 } } } }$$\n\nFilling in the formula we get:\n\n$$t = \\dfrac { 23.92 - 22.61 }{ \\sqrt { \\dfrac { { 4.8 }^{ 2 } }{ 50 } + \\dfrac { { 6.2 }^{ 2 } }{ 50 } } } = 1.18$$\n\nSince our hypothesis is one-sided in the greater than direction, we are now looking for $p(t > 1.18)$. In order to calculate this, we must first determine the degrees of freedom. In a $t$-test for means, we choose the smaller of: ${ n }_{ 1 } - 1$ and ${ n }_{ 2 } - 1$\n\nHere, $df = 50–1 = 49$.\n\nTo find the $p$-value, use your TI83/84 graphing calculator's tcdf function. The syntax is: tcdf(lower bound, upper bound, df).\n\nIn this case you would:\n\nThe calculator will return the $p$-value of $p = 0.12$\n\nNote: on a free-response problem it is very important to show all of your work. However, on a multiple choice problem of this nature, you can find the $p$-value directly using your TI83/84 graphing calculator.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\nEnter and the calculator will return a $p$-value of $p = 0.12$. You might also notice that the calculator identifies $df = 92.21$. This value represents a more accurate degrees of freedom than we used in the calculation above. However, our $p$-value matches the $p$-value from using the calculator's $2$-sample $t$-test.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect and represents the $p$-value associated with using a two-sided alternative hypothesis of ${ H }_{ 0 }: { \\mu }_{ C } \\neq { \\mu }_{ A }$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. It is the sum of the values identified in Choices 'A' and 'B'. However, there is no logical reason to choose this value.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and represents the complement of Choice 'B'. That is $1 – 0.24 = 0.76$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and represents the complement of Choice 'A' or $p(t < 1.18)$. Here, $1 – 0.12 = 0.88$.",
