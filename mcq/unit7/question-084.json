  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "question_text": "Ronald decided to do a two-sided significance test for the mean number of french fries contained in a large order of fries from his favorite fast food restaurant. To gather data, he visited the restaurant on a random sample of $10\\text{ days}$ and found the average number of french fries contained in his large orders of fries on each of those days. Ronald cannot remember what the actual average was, but he does remember that the $t$-statistic for his test was $1.98$.<br>Assuming that the conditions for completing the significance test were satisfied, what was the corresponding $p$-value for this test?",

  "solution": "We are told to assume that the conditions for completing the significance test are satisfied, and we know the $t$-statistic from the test is $t = 1.98$. To calculate the corresponding $p$-value, we must also know the degrees of freedom (df). For a $t$-test for a population mean:\n\n$$df = n - 1$$\n\n...where $n$ is the sample size.\n\nRonald collected his sample of fries on $10$ days, therefore $df = 10 - 1 = 9$.\n\nThere are two ways to determine the corresponding $p$-value. Remember, we are finding a $p$-value for a two-sided hypothesis test! Since the given $t$-statistic is positive, we will find $p(t > 1.98)$ and then double our result to obtain the two-sided $p$-value.\n\nMethod 1:\n\nUse your TI83/84 graphing calculator's tcdf function. The tcdf function finds the area under the $t$ distribution associated with given $t$-statistics and corresponding degrees of freedom. The syntax is: tcdf(lower bound, upper bound, df). Since there is no upper bound, we will use ${ 10 }^{ 99 }$ as our upper bound to ensure that our answer is quite accurate.\n\nPress 2nd\nPress VARS (Distr)\nChoose 5 (tcdf)\nEnter 1.98, 10 ^ 99 , 9\nPress Enter\n\nThe calculator will return the one-sided $p$-value of $0.0395$.\n\nMultiply this value by $2$ to obtain the two-sided $p$-value of $p = 0.0790$.\n\nMethod 2:\n\nUse the $t$-table provided with the reference materials found on the AP exam. The $t$-table provides upper tail probabilities associated with $t$-statistics and corresponding degrees of freedom.\n\nFirst, look down the column labeled df to find $df = 9$. Look across this row and try to find a $t$-statistic of $t = 1.98$. This value will not be found in the table. However, we know:\n\n$$1.833 < 1.98 < 2.262.$$\n\nSince $1.833$ and $2.262$ are found in the table, we can use these values to help us determine the appropriate $p$-value for this test. Look to the top of the column containing $t = 1.833$. Here you will find that the associated upper tail probability is $0.05$. That is:\n\n$$p(t > 1.833) = 0.05.$$\n\nLooking at the top of the column containing $t = 2.262$ we find the associated upper tail probability to be $0.025$. That is:\n\n$$p(t > 2.262) = 0.025.$$\n\nSince:\n\n$$1.833 < 1.98 < 2.262$$\n\n...we know that:\n\n$$0.025 < p(t = 1.98) < 0.05.$$\n\nThese are one-sided $p$-values. Then:\n\n$$2(0.025) < 2p(t = 1.98) < 2(0.05).$$\n\nFinally:\n\n$$0.05 <$\nour $p$-value $< 0.10$$\n\nChoice 'D' offers the only $p$-value in this interval.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. It is the one-sided $p$-value that would be obtained from using a normal distribution rather than the $t$-distribution.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. It is the one-sided $p$-value for the test.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. It is the two-sided $p$-value that would be obtained from using a normal distribution rather than the $t$-distribution.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Knowing the sample average along with the sample standard deviation would enable us to calculate the $t$-statistic. However, since we already know the value of the $t$-statistic, we can calculate our $p$-value directly.",
