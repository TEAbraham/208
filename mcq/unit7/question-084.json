  "question_text": "Ronald decided to do a two-sided significance test for the mean number of french fries contained in a large order of fries from his favorite fast food restaurant.  To gather data, he visited the restaurant on a random sample of $10\\text{ days}$ and found the average number of french fries contained in his large orders of fries on each of those days.  Ronald cannot remember what the actual average was, but he does remember that the $t$ -statistic for his test was $1.98$ . Assuming that the conditions for completing the significance test were satisfied, what was the corresponding $p$ -value for this test?",
