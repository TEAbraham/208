  "solution": "In order for the results of a significance test to be considered statistically significant, the $p$-value of the test must be less than the significance level, $\\alpha$. Therefore, if Lauren's initial results were statistically significant, we know her $p$-value was less than $0.05$.\n\nTo understand how increasing the degrees of freedom will affect the $p$-value and statistical significance of the test, it is helpful to know some of the characteristics of the $t$-distributions.\n\nWhile all $t$-distributions are unimodal and symmetric about the mean, $t$-distributions corresponding to a low $\\text{df}$ will have greater variability and more probability in the tails than will $t$-distributions corresponding to higher $\\text{df}$.\n\nAs the degrees of freedom increase, the shape of a $t$-distribution will approach normal and there will be less probability in the tails. Therefore, increasing the $\\text{df}$ will decrease the $p$-value.\n\nYou can also use your TI83/84 calculator's tcdf function to help you understand that increasing the $\\text{df}$will result in a lower $p$-value. The tcdf function shows the probability associated with a specific $t$-statistic and a given $\\text{df}$. The syntax is: *tcdf(lower bound, upper bound, df**. Choose any reasonable $t$-statistic. For example, a $t$-statistic of $t=0.5$ and a one-sided (greater than) assumption is used in the calculator instructions that follow. Since no upper bound exists, we can use a large value as the upper bound to ensure accuracy.\n\nPress $2\\text{nd}$\nPress VARS (DISTR)\nChoose tcdf\nEnter $0.5, 1000,2$\nPress ENTER\n\nThe calculator will return a $p$-value of $p=0.333$ when $\\text{df}=2$.\n\nTry again with a larger $\\text{df}$. For example, if we let $\\text{df}=10$, the calculator will return a $p$-value of $p=0.314$. Increasing the $\\text{df}$ decreases the $p$-value.\n\nChoice 'D' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'A' and 'B' are incorrect because they both claim that the $p$-value would increase.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Once the significance level, $\\alpha$ has be set, any $p$-value less than $\\alpha$ would be considered statistically significant. It is not possible for the $p$-value to be \"too low\".\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It does not really matter if the alternative hypothesis was one-sided or two-sided. If the initial $p$-value resulted in statistical significance for either type of alternative hypothesis, the lower $p$-value that results from the higher $\\text{df}$ will still result in statistical significance.",
