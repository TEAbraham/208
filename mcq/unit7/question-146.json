  "question_text": "Nellie's Nachos is a fast food restaurant chain that has locations in many cities throughout the United States. In one Nellie's Nachos restaurant located on the west coast, the average number of customers served per day is $330$ with a standard deviation of $45$. In one Nellie's Nachos restaurant located on the east coast, the average number of customers served per day is $315$ with a standard deviation of $60$.<br>Assume the distribution of the number of customers served per day is approximately normal at both locations. Also assume that the number of customers served at one store is independent of the number of customers served at the other store.<br>What is the probability that on one randomly selected day, the number of customers served in the east coast location is greater than the number of customers served in the west coast location?",

  "solution": "The number of customers served daily at the west coast location is a random variable which we will call $W$. The number of customers served daily at the east coast location is also a random variable which we will call $E$.\n\nWe are looking for the probability that the number of customers served at the east coast location on a randomly selected day is greater than the number of customers served at the west coast location. That is, we are looking for $p(E > W)$, which is the same as $p(E – W) > 0$.\n\nWe are given the assumption that the number of customers served at one store is independent of the number of customers served at the other store. We are also told to assume that the distribution of the number of customers for both locations is approximately normal, so we can assume that the distribution of the differences will also be approximately normally distributed.\n\nStart by organizing the given information and add information about the variances. Remember: variances of independent random variables add (even when looking at the difference between two distributions), while standard deviations do not add.\n\n$${\\mu}_E= 315, \\quad {\\sigma}_E= 60, \\quad {\\sigma}^2_E = 3600$$\n\n$${\\mu}_W= 330, \\quad {\\sigma}_W= 45, \\quad {\\sigma}^2_W= 2025$$\n\n$$\\Downarrow$$\n\n$${\\mu}_{E-W}={\\mu}_E- {\\mu}_W= 315 - 330 = -15$$\n\n$${\\sigma}^2_{E-W}= {\\sigma}^2_E+ {\\sigma}^2_W = 3600 + 2025 =5625$$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ E-W }=\\sqrt { 5625 } =75$$\n\nTo find the probability:\n\n$$p(E-W>0)=p\\left( z>\\frac { 0-\\left( -15 \\right) }{ 75 } \\right) =p(z>0.2)=0.4207$$\n\nYou can find this probability using the $z$-table, or using your TI83/84 graphing calculator's normalcdf function. The normalcdf function finds probabilities associated with the normal distribution curve.\n\nThe syntax is: normalcdf(lower bound, upper bound, mean, standard deviation).\n\nIn this case you can enter:\n\n2nd, DISTR, choose normalcdf, then enter (0.2, 10^99, 0,1)\n\nThe calculator will return the value of $0.4207$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. You will arrive at this answer if you incorrectly find the standard deviation of the distribution for $E - W$ to be $15$ by subtracting the individual standard deviations $(60 – 45 = 15)$. The following calculation is incorrect:\n\n$$p(E-W>0)=p\\left( z>\\frac { 0-\\left( -15 \\right) }{ 15 } \\right) =p(z>1)=0.1587$$\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. You will arrive at this answer if you incorrectly find the variance for the distribution of $E - W$ by subtracting (rather than adding) the individual variances. The following calculations are incorrect:\n\n$${\\sigma}^2_{E-W} = {\\sigma}^2_E - {\\sigma}^2_W = 3600 -2025 = 1575$$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{E-W}=\\sqrt { 1575 } =39.686$$\n\n$$p(E-W>0)=p\\left( z>\\frac { 0-\\left( -15 \\right) }{ 39.686 } \\right) =p(z>0.378)=0.3527$$\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This answer is based upon the mistaken assumption that since the mean number of customers served per day at the west coast location is $15$ more than at the east coast location, while the standard deviation for the east coast location is $15$ more than for the west coast location, the two measures will somehow cancel each other out. This is not the case.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. You will arrive at this answer by reversing the direction of the inequality. This answer represents $p(E – W) < 0$ and is the complement of answer Choice 'C' or $1 –$ the probability identified in Choice 'C'.\n\nThe following calculation is incorrect:\n\n$$p(E-W<0)=p\\left( z<\\frac { 0-\\left( -15 \\right) }{ 75 } \\right) =p(z<0.2)=0.5793$$",
