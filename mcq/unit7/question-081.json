  "question_text": "An exercise physiologist is interested in the effect of exercise on heart rate. She has the subjects walk slowly for $5\\text{ minutes}$ and records their heart rates. Then she has the subjects run vigorously for $5\\text{ minutes}$ and records their heart rates again. The differences are recorded (heart rate after running - heart rate before running), with results below: One-Sample $T$ : Differences Test of $\\mu = 0$ vs. $\\mu \\neq 0$ Variable N Mean StDev SE Mean 95% CI T P Differences 8 59.88 10.36 3.66 (51.22,68.53) 16.35 0.000 Why could a confidence interval be more useful in this situation than a hypothesis test?",
