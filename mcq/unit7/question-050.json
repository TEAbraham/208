Ten years ago, there was shown to be an average of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$12$</span> chips per cookie.  The current company president decided to randomly sample <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100$</span> cookies off the line and have the chips counted.  He wanted to show that there were even more chips per cookie now.  Write the hypotheses that would be used for such a test.</div>",
