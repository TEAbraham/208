  "solution": "Statement I is true; a confidence interval can take a sample mean and help give a range where the unknown population mean could be.\n\nStatement II is false; there is no reason to construct an interval to estimate sample mean as the sample mean can easily be calculated with the data gathered.\n\nStatement III is true; when dealing with two sample means or two sample proportions, a confidence interval can be used to estimate the difference in the populations.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
