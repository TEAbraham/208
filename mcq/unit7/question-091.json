  "solution": "The $z$-score found from the sample mean was positive, therefore, we know that the sample mean was a larger value than was hypothesized in $H_0$. Since a $p$-value finds the probability of obtaining a sample statistic at least as far away from the hypothesized mean as the statistic that we actually calculated, we need to find $p(z > 1.95)$. However, our test is stated to be $2$-sided. Therefore, once we know $p(z > 1.95)$, we must then double our result in order to find the $2$-sided $p$-value.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to use the normalcdf function on your TI83/84 graphing calculator. The syntax is: normalcdf(lower bound, upper bound, mean, standard deviation). In this case:\n\nEnter 2nd, DISTR,\nChoose normalcdf\nEnter 1.95, 10^99, 0, 1\n\n\n\nThe calculator will return the value of about $0.02559$.\nNow multiply this value by $2$ to find the $2$-sided $p$-value of $0.0512$.\n\nUsing the $z$-table, there is an easier way to accomplish this. Start by realizing that the normal distribution is symmetric around a mean $z$-score of $0$. It should make sense then, that $p(z < -1.95) = p(z > 1.95)$. Find $p(z < -1.95)$ by looking at the table and following the first column for $z$ down to $-1.9$, then follow across that row until it intersects with $0.05$. The value found here corresponds with a $z$-score of $-1.95$ and provides $p(z < -1.95) = 0.0256$. Now, simply multiply by $2$ to arrive at the final answer of $p = 0.0512$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. It confuses the probability with the $z$-score and misplaces the decimal in the $z$-score given. A $z$-score of $-0.86$ corresponds with an area to the left of approximately $0.195$.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This is $p(z < -1.95)$ and does not take into account the $2$-sided nature of our hypothesis test. Alternatively, it is also $p(z > 1.95)$, but still does not take into account the $2$-sided nature of the test.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. It simply moves the decimal in the given $z$-score and assumes it to be a probability. Not good.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It gives $p(z < 1.95)$ perhaps forgetting the fact that the $z$-table always provides the area to the left of the identified $z$-score.",
