  "question_text": "Jessica Rabbit loves carrot chips and buys one ounce bags to pack with her lunch. According to the label, there are an average of $25\\text{ chips per ounce}$. Jessica suspects that the true average is lower and decides to investigate. She selects $12\\text{ bags of chips}$ (which she is willing to consider a random sample) and finds the average number of chips per bag is $23.4$ with a standard deviation of $4.6$.<br>Assuming all conditions are satisfied, what is the $p$-value for the appropriate statistical test?",

  "solution": "Jessica is interested in a population mean, but only knows the standard deviation of her sample. A one-sample $t$-test is appropriate with the following hypotheses:\n\n$${ H }_{ 0 }: \\mu = 25$$\n\n$${ H }_{ a }: \\mu < 25$$\n\n...where $\\mu$ is the true average number of carrot chips in a $1\\text{-ounce}$ bag.\n\nWe are told to assume that all conditions for performing the test are satisfied, so we can proceed to finding the value of the $t$-statistic. The formula is:\n\n$$t = \\frac { \\overline { x } - \\mu }{ \\dfrac { s }{ \\sqrt { n } } }$$\n\nFilling in the formula:\n\n$$t = \\frac { 23.4 - 25 }{ \\dfrac { 4.6 }{ \\sqrt { 12 } } } = -1.205$$\n\nSince our hypothesis is one-sided in the less than direction, we are now looking for $p(t < -1.205)$.\n\nIn order to calculate this, we must first determine the degrees of freedom. In a $t$-test for means, $df = n – 1$ where $n$ is the number of observations.\n\nHere, $n = 12$, so $df = 12 – 1 = 11$. To find the $p$-value, use your TI83/84 graphing calculator's tcdf function. The syntax is: tcdf(lower bound, upper bound, df).\n\nIn this case, you would:\n\nNote: on a free-response problem it is very important to show all of your work. However, on a multiple choice problem of this nature, you can find the $p$-value directly using your TI83/84 graphing calculator.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and represents the $p$-value you would obtain by running a $z$-test and considering the sample standard deviation to be the population standard deviation.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect and represents the $p$-value associated with a two-sided alternative hypothesis of ${ H }_{ 0 }:\\mu \\neq 25$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and represents the complement of the correct answer. That is, it represents $p(t > -1.205)$ and is calculated as $1 – 0.127 = 0.873$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and represents the complement of the answer in Choice 'A'. That is: $1 – 0.114 = 0.886$.",
