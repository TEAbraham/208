While marked at $16$ ounces, the company was concerned whether it was meeting this amount. A random sample of $36$ cans was taken and the sample mean was found to be $16.2$ ounces with a standard deviation of $0.8$ ounces.\nFind the value of the $t$ statistic as well as its degrees of freedom.<br>Find the value of the $t$ statistic as well as its degrees of freedom.",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nFirst we find the value of the t statistic given by this formula:\n\n$$t=\\dfrac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}}$$\n\n...where $\\bar{x}$ is the sample mean, $\\mu$ is the assumed population mean, $s$ is the sample standard deviation, and $n$ is the sample size.\n\nIn this problem we assume that the population mean is the given $16$ ounces and that the sample information gives us an $\\bar{x}=16.2$ and an $s=0.8$. The sample size, $n$, $=36$ cans. Plugging these numbers in we get:\n\n$t=\\dfrac{16.2-16}{\\frac{0.8}{\\sqrt{36}}}$, so $t = 1.5$\n\nThe degrees of freedom are found using the formula $n-1$, so for this problem our d.f.$=36-1=35$.\n\nSo, Choice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because the d.f. value is $36$ instead of $35$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because the $\\bar{x}$ and $\\mu$ terms are reversed in the formula.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the $n$ and $s$ values are reversed. Also the d.f. value is incorrect.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because the square root of $n$ was not taken.",
