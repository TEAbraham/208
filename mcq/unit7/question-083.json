  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "For sample sizes of approximately $10$ to $30$, the sampling distribution will be roughly normal as long as the data graphed shows no strong skewness or outliers.\n\nKeep in mind, however, that sampling distributions gradually look closer to normal as sample size increases, and $10$ and $30$ are not strict cutoffs.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
