  "question_text": "A nutritionist was interested in the average amount of water a person drinks per day. She interviewed $20$ randomly chosen subjects and found that they drink an average of $33.1$ ounces of water per day with a standard deviation of $7.4$ ounces. In this situation, under what conditions could the nutritionist perform a one-sample T-test or one-sample T-interval?",

      "letter": "B",
      "text": "If the data graphed of the 20 20 subjects shows perfect normality, she could perform a one-sample T-test; however, a one-sample T-interval would still be inappropriate in this situation."

    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "As long as the graph of the 20 20 subjects shows no outliers and no strong skewness, T procedures such as a one-sample T-test and one-sample T-interval are safe to use here."
