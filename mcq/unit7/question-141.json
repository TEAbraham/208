  "solution": "Performing a two-sample $T$-test using a calculator or software package gives a p-value of $0.19575$. At alpha levels $1\\%$, $5\\%$, or $10\\%$, this is a high $p$-value. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence to reject the null.\n\nSpecifically, there is insufficient evidence that the second store has employees with more experience than the first store.\n\nNote: A high $p$-value can never be thought of as “evidence.”\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
