  "question_text": "Two large supermarket chains are interested in comparing the experience, in years, that their employees have. The summary statistics are below: Store $1$ : mean = $5.4, { S }_{ x }= 3.2, n = 34 $ Store $2$ : mean = $6.1, { S }_{ x }= 3.6, n = 36$ When performing a two-sample $T$ -test on $H_0: { u }_{ 1 }={ u }_{ 2 }$ versus $H_a:  { u }_{ 1 } < { u }_{ 2 } $ , what conclusion can be made? Define ${ u }_{ 1 }$ as the average experience at store $1$ , and ${ u }_{ 2 }$ as the average experience at store $2$ .",
