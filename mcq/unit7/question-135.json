  "question_text": "A sports reporter randomly surveyed 53 football linemen from large universities (enrollment $ > 10{,}000$ ) and randomly surveyed $53$ football linemen from smaller colleges (enrollment $ < 10{,}000 $ ). Suppose the researcher wished to test whether linemen from large universities are heavier than linemen from smaller colleges. He finds that the average weight of linemen at large universities is $287\\text{ lbs}$ , while the average weight of linemen at small colleges is $268\\text{ lbs}$ . Which of the following statements is true?",
