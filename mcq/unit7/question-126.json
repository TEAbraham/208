  "solution": "Most likely these samples are not independent. On certain days when one hotel is busy, the other hotel is also more likely to be busy. Also, it is quite possible the last $4\\text{ weeks}$ are not necessarily representative of the hotel business in this town.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; there are $7\\text{ days}$ in a week, so each sample consists of $7\\cdot 4 = 28\\text{ days}$. Two samples each of size $28$ is large enough to ensure approximate normality for $T$ procedures.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; this condition checks for normality in proportions not means.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; there is nothing in the problem that suggests any bias.",
