Sixty-two headache patients are randomly selected from several large medical practices and half of them are given one drug and half the other drug.  Determination of which drug was given to which patient was decided by a coin flip and all conditions were verified.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Three months later the total number of headaches suffered by each group was gathered.  Group <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1$</span> had <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2.1$</span> headaches per person with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1.2$</span> headaches.  Group <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2$</span> had <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2.9$</span> headaches per person with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1.6$</span> headaches.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">If the upper bound of the confidence interval came out to be <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.02$</span>, find the value of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$t^{*}$</span> that was used in the calculation of this confidence interval.</div>",
