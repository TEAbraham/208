  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The margin of error represents the length of point estimate to one of the endpoints of the interval. To put it in simpler terms, it is half the length of the interval.\n\nTo find the margin of error in this case, use the following:\n$$Margin\\quad of\\quad Error\\quad =\\quad \\frac { Maximum\\quad -\\quad Minimum\\quad }{ 2 } $$\n\n$$\\frac { 40-30 }{ 2 } = 5$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors Choice 'B' is incorrect as this is the range of the interval. Choice 'C' is incorrect as this is the point estimate(center) of the interval. Choice 'D' is incorrect as this represents the endpoints added together.",
