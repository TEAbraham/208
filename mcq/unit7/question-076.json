  "question_text": "In recent years, new rules have been put in place to try to speed up the amount of time it takes to complete a professional baseball game. Before these rules were enacted, the mean length of a professional baseball game was about $172\\text{ minutes}$.<br>Hank decided to do a statistical test to see if the mean length of a professional baseball game is now less than $172\\text{ minutes}$. From a random sample of $20\\text{ games}$ played under the new rules, he found the mean length of a game to be $163\\text{ minutes}$ with a standard deviation of $21.2\\text{ minutes}$.<br>When conducting his test, what value would Hank use for the standard error of the statistic?",
