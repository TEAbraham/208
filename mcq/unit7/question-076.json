Before these rules were enacted, the mean length of a professional baseball game was about <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$172\\text{ minutes}$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Hank decided to do a statistical test to see if the mean length of a professional baseball game is now less than <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$172\\text{ minutes}$</span>.  From a random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$20\\text{ games}$</span> played under the new rules, he found the mean length of a game to be <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$163\\text{ minutes}$</span> with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$21.2\\text{ minutes}$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">When conducting his test, what value would Hank use for the standard error of the statistic?</div>",
