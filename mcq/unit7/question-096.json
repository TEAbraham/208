  "question_text": "A company was hired to compare the bounce height of two brands of tennis balls using a $90\\%$ confidence interval. A bounce method was established and $15$ balls were randomly selected and tested from each brand. Brand $1$ had a mean bounce height of $5.8$ feet and a standard deviation of $1.1$ feet. Brand $2$ had a bounce height of $5.3$ feet and a standard deviation of $0.9$ feet.\nAssuming that all conditions were met and that a $d.f. = 14$ would be used, find the margin of error of this confidence interval.",
