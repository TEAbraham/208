A bounce method was established and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$15$</span> balls were randomly selected and tested from each brand.  Brand <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1$</span> had a mean bounce height of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5.8$</span> feet and a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1.1$</span> feet.  Brand <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2$</span> had a bounce height of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5.3$</span> feet and a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.9$</span> feet.  Assuming that all conditions were met and that a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$d.f. = 14$</span> would be used, find the margin of error of this confidence interval.</div>",
