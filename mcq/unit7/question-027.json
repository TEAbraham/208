  "question_text": "Which of the statements is true?<br><br>I. The area under the $t$-distribution curve to the right of a positive $t$ value with $6$ degrees of freedom is larger than the area to the right of the same t value with $18$ degrees of freedom.<br>II. The higher the degrees of freedom, the closer the $t$-distribution is to the standard normal distribution.<br>III. The $t$-distribution is appropriate to use when the population standard deviation is known.",

  "solution": "Statement I is true. For small degrees of freedom, the areas in the tails of the $t$-distribution are larger than for large degrees of freedom.\n\nStatement II is true. To verify, look at the bottom row of a table of values for the $t$-distribution. The values are the same as for the standard normal distribution.\n\nStatement III is false. When the population standard deviation is known, the standard normal distribution should be used.",
