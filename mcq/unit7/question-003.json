  "question_text": "A teacher at a large high school is interested in finding the average standardized test score for all students in the school. The teacher selects a random sample of $150$ students from the school and finds a mean score of $1050$. In actuality, the mean of the whole school is $1125$ with a standard deviation $50$.<br>What number in the scenario represents a statistic?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nRemember, a statistic is a number the represents a sample. Therefore, when the teacher found the mean of the sample, this number is a sample mean, $\\bar{x} = 1050$.\n\nSince all the other numbers are either sample sizes or parameter values, $\\bar{x} = 1050$ is the only statistic given.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Since $50$ is the standard deviation of all students, the population, this number is a parameter value.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. $150$ is the sample size, and therefore not a statistic.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. $1125$ is the mean of the entire population, thus it is a parameter value as well.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since $1050$ is the mean of the sample, it is a statistic. So there is a given statistic value in the question.",
