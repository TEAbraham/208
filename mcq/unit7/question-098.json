Forty-two headache patients are randomly selected from several large medical practices and half of them are given one drug and half the other drug.  Determination of which drug was given to which patient was decided by a coin flip.  Means and standard deviations of the subjects are obtained.  What conditions need to be verified in order to continue with this study and create a confidence interval?</div>",
