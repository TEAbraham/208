They were sure that that was too high and thought that certainly, the average GPA was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$3.60$</span> at the most. The students in the class decided to take a random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$200$</span> students from the school to show that the mean GPA in their school was really lower than what the school claimed.  How would they write the hypotheses for their one-sample <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$t$</span>-test?</div>",
