  "question_text": "The students in an AP Statistics class heard that their average school grade point average (GPA) was $3.92$. They were sure that that was too high and thought that certainly, the average GPA was $3.60$ at the most. The students in the class decided to take a random sample of $200$ students from the school to show that the mean GPA in their school was really lower than what the school claimed. How would they write the hypotheses for their one-sample $t$-test?",
