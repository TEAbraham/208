Many post offices in each city were randomly sampled as to how long mail took to be delivered within each city. They found a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$95\\%$</span> confidence interval for delivery times for first-class mail in hours at <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$(0.43, 1.26)$</span>. Interpret this confidence interval.</div>",
