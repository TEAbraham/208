The wellness center believes there is statistically significant evidence that women's exercise heart rate is greater than men's. Let ${ \\mu }_{ W }$ represent the average exercise heart rate of women and ${ \\mu }_{ M }$ represent the average exercise heart rate of men.<br>Which of the following would represent the null and alternative hypotheses?",
