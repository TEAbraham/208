  "question_text": "A wellness center is running an experiment comparing  the exercise heart rate of men versus women.  Two large independent random samples of men and women are taken. The wellness center believes there is statistically significant evidence that women's exercise heart rate is greater than men's. Let ${ \\mu  }_{ W }$ represent the average exercise heart rate of women and ${ \\mu  }_{ M }$ represent the average exercise heart rate of men. Which of the following would represent the null and alternative hypotheses?",
