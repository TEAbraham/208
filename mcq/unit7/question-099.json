  "question_text": "Two competing universities each believed that they better prepared their students for law school. They hired an independent researcher to create a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the difference between the mean LSAT scores of the two schools. Thirty-five pre-law students from each school were randomly selected. At School $1$ the mean LSAT score was $171$ with a standard deviation of $14$. At School $2$ the mean LSAT score was $168$ with a standard deviation of $11$.\nUsing Table B for your critical value, which is the correct $95\\%$ confidence interval for the difference between the mean LSAT scores of the two schools?",
