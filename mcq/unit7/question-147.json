  "question_text": "Jedidiah and Octavius have both visited the American Museum of Natural History in New York City as well as the British Museum in London. They have been wondering if the average number of daily visitors at each museum is equal and decide to investigate. From a random sample of $30\\text{ days}$, they determine that the mean number of daily visitors to the American Museum of Natural History is $16,380$ with a sample standard deviation of $1248$ while, the mean number of daily visitors to the British Museum is $18,104$ with a sample standard deviation of $4296$.<br>Assuming the samples are independent, and that the distribution of the number of daily visitors is approximately normal for both locations, does this data provide evidence that there is a difference in the mean number of daily visitors to these two museums?",
