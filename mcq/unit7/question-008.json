  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">In biology class, you learn that the salinity of brackish water (water that is saltier than fresh water, but less salty than ocean water) generally has a mean of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$20$</span> parts per thousand (ppt).  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">You go to a nature preserve located near the ocean every day at <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span> p.m. for <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> successive days and measure the salinity of the water at the same spot in the estuary, where fresh water and ocean water mix and mingle.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">At the end of the time period, you calculate the mean and standard deviation of the salinity of your <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> data points and carry out a one-sample t-test about the mean, calculating the test statistic and the p-value.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What assumption concerning hypothesis testing have you violated in carrying out this experiment?</div>",
