  "title": "Brackish Water Salinity",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "In biology class, you learn that the salinity of brackish water (water that is saltier than fresh water, but less salty than ocean water) generally has a mean of $20$ parts per thousand (ppt).<br>You go to a nature preserve located near the ocean every day at $4$ p.m. for $40$ successive days and measure the salinity of the water at the same spot in the estuary, where fresh water and ocean water mix and mingle.<br>At the end of the time period, you calculate the mean and standard deviation of the salinity of your $40$ data points and carry out a one-sample t-test about the mean, calculating the test statistic and the p-value.<br>What assumption concerning hypothesis testing have you violated in carrying out this experiment?",
