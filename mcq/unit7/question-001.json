  "question_text": "A data scientist reads the average screen time for high school students is approximately $8$ hours a day. To investigate, the data scientist collects multiple random samples of $40$ high school students and calculates the average screen time for each sample. He then summarizes the data on the dotplot below:\nWhat proportion of samples produced a mean of $8$ hours or more?",

  "solution": "When looking at the distribution of sample means with a sample of size\n40\n, you can see the data scientist took\n28\nsamples of size\n40\n. Therefore, to find the proportion of samples that produced a mean of\n8\nor more hours, you need to count the observations at\n8\nor more. When counting the observations, you can see there are\n5\nobservations at\n8\nor more.\n\nTherefore, the proportion of observations that produce a sample mean of\n8\nor more hours is\n5\n28\n=\n0.179\n.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
