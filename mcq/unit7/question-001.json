  "question_text": "A data scientist reads the average screen time for high school students is approximately $8$ hours a day. To investigate, the data scientist collects multiple random samples of $40$ high school students and  calculates the average screen time for each sample. He then summarizes the data on the dotplot below: What proportion of samples produced a mean of $8$ hours or more?",

  "solution": "When looking at the distribution of sample means with a sample of size 40 40 , you can see the data scientist took 28 28 samples of size 40 40 . Therefore, to find the proportion of samples that produced a mean of 8 8 or more hours, you need to count the observations at 8 8 or more. When counting the observations, you can see there are 5 5 observations at 8 8 or more.\n\nTherefore, the proportion of observations that produce a sample mean of 8 8 or more hours is 5 28 = 0.179 5 28 = 0.179 .\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
