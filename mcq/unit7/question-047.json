  "question_text": "A dietician tests a new diet plan on $20\\text{ groups of people}$ , with $14\\text{ people in each group}$ . All participants were randomly selected from a large group of volunteers, and all participants followed the diet plan. Two months later, the dietician obtains the sample mean weight loss and standard deviation for each group and performs $20$ one-sample $t$ -tests. She notes that one of these tests is statistically significant, with a $p$ -value of $0.034$ . She then touts her diet plan on a television infomercial, claiming that her plan results in significant weight loss at an $\\alpha = 0.05$ significance level. What can be said about her claim?",
