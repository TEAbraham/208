  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "A shoe company claims that its lighter sneaker can make you run faster than its competitor's top running sneaker. The company randomly selects $200$ people that attend a seminar about the sneaker. Each subject runs a 100-meter dash with the company's new running sneaker and the competitors' top running sneaker. Subjects are randomized with respect to which type of sneaker they would run with first.<br>What type of interval would the company use to construct an average difference between the running times for the company's new running sneaker and the competitor's top running sneaker?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "This is paired, because the two types of sneakers are paired to the subjects, meaning each subject receives both treatments. It is also a $t$-interval, because we are using the sample standard deviation (standard error). If you have a problem remembering whether to use the $z$- or $t$-interval, remember the phrase, \"Mr. T is mean\". This indicates that you should use $t$-intervals for means.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Since we do not know the standard deviation of the population (we are sampling $200$ people), it cannot be a $z$-interval.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Each subject is receiving both treatments, which indicates a match pair design. Also, since we do not know the standard deviation of the population (we are sampling $200$ people), it cannot be a $z$-interval.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Each subject is receiving both treatments, which indicates a match paired design.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. We are looking for the average difference, which indicates that we are dealing with means.",
