  "difficulty": "Difficult",
  "question_text": "Rose Wells has captured an alien and decides to keep it as a pet. Always curious, Rose wonders if the alien's average body temperature is the same as is normal for humans ( $98.6^\\circ$ ) and decides to do a significance test. Below are the alien's temperature readings, gathered at $6$ randomly selected times: $85.1, 99.8, 93.7, 105.6, 98.2, 100.4$ If Rose assumes that the alien's body temperature follows a normal distribution, what would be the $p$ -value of an appropriate significance test?",
