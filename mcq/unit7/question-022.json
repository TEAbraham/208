  "question_text": "College graduates purchase their gowns based on their height.  One graduation gown manufacturer measures a sample of graduates to see if it needs to increase its inventory in the taller sizes.  The average height in the random sample of customers was $67\\text{ inches}$ with a standard deviation of $4\\text{ inches}$ . Which distribution should the manufacturer use to calculate a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the average height of its customers?  Why?",
