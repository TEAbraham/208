Assume that the distribution of both populations are approximately normal. The results are below:\nTwo-Sample T for Urban Weights vs. Rural Weights\nN Mean StDev SE Mean\nUrban Weights 15 126.1 10.5 2.7\nRural Weights 16 128.8 13.2 3.3\n\n\n$\\text{ Difference }= \\mu \\text{ (Urban Weights)} - \\mu \\text{ (Rural Weights)}$\nEstimate for difference: $-2.68$\n$95\\%$ confidence interval for difference: ($-11.45, 6.09$)\n$\\text{T-test of difference }= 0$\n$\\text{T-value }= -0.63$\n$\\text{ P-value }= 0.537$\n$\\text{ DF }= 28$\nWhat can one conclude from the results of the two-sample $T$-test?",
