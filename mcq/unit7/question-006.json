  "question_text": "A high school principal claims that his students spend an average of $50$ minutes on their homework each night. The Statistics teacher does not believe the Principal's claim is true. To test the claim, the teacher decides to model a sampling distribution of samples of $30$ random students from the large high school.<br>Given is the graph of the sampling distribution for the average amount of time spent on homework for $30$ students<br>Should the teacher believe the Principal's claim that students at this school typically work on homework for an average of $50$ minutes per day?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nWhen looking to see if a value is a plausible value for a true parameter value, we can see if it happens during trials of chance behavior. In this instance, the teacher selected random samples of students to simulate a sampling distribution of sample means. In the sampling distribution, we see that there are four dots at $50$ and two dots at $55$ (which is also evidence for $50$).\n\nTherefore, since we have a fair amount of dots, in fact $\\frac{6}{26} \\approx 23\\%$ of the time, we believe that the Principal is not lying with his claim.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The fact that the graph is Normal is important for testing the claim, but it does not provide evidence for the Principal's claim.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. The graph's center is a good place to start the examination, but we wanted to test the claim of $50$ or more, so we need to count the dots at $50$ or above.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. While it is true there are four dots at $50$, the dots at $55$ are also evidence for the Principal's claim. Therefore, we can say since $50$ or more happened $\\approx 23\\%$ of the time, we can believe his claim.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It would be next to impossible for the teacher to ask all the students (commonly known as a census), and when we want to make inferences, we typically do so with random samples like above.",
