  "question_text": "A medical study was being done. Two groups of patients were involved, each group receiving a different strength of a new trial drug designed to reduce the number of headaches they had. From each group, $25$ random patients were selected to receive the drug, while the remainder received a placebo. In Group L, the group receiving the lower dosage, the mean number of headaches over the past month was $19.0$ with a standard deviation of $1.6$. In Group H, the group receiving the higher dosage, the mean number of headaches over the past month was $18.1$ with a standard deviation of $1.3$. The doctors were looking to see if there was a difference in the number of headaches between the two groups.\nGiven a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$, what can you conclude?",
