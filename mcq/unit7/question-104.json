  "solution": "This question deals with a $2$-sample $t$-interval for means. This is a $t$-interval and not a $z$-interval because we don't know the standard deviation of the population. Remember the phrase, \"Mr. T is mean.\" The formula for a two sample $t$-interval for means is:\n\n$$(\\overline { { x }_{ 1 } } -\\overline { { x }_{ 2 } } )\\pm { { t }_{ d.o.f. } }\\cdot \\sqrt { \\dfrac { { { (s }_{ 1 } })^{ 2 } }{ { n }_{ 1 } } +\\dfrac { { { (s }_{ 2 } })^{ 2 } }{ { n }_{ 2 } } }$$\n\nTo find the critical value, in this case, is difficult. You can run the interval test on your calculator to get the D.O.F., which in this case $108.82$. Then, do InvT$(.975,108.82)$, and that will give you the critical value of $1.982$. The reason for $.975$ or $97.5\\%$ is because InvT represents the area to the left. The $95\\%$ is the central area and you must add the $2.5\\%$ on the remaining left tail. This will give $97.5\\%$.\n\nAn easier way is to approximate and look at the $t$-distribution table. Find where $75$ D.O.F. and $95\\%$ confidence intersect, which in this case is $1.992$. $1.982$ is closer to $1.992$ than $1.96$.\n\nFinally, you could always get the answer for the interval on your calculator. Then do the arithmetic out for the available choices and see which one matches.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. When dealing with means, we are working with $t$-intervals and not $z$-intervals. The critical value in Choice 'A' is $1.96$, which is the critical value for $95\\%$ confidence interval for $z$.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect as well, because of the critical value and the standard error components are wrong.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect, as the standard error component is wrong.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect, as no critical value is given.",
