  "question_text": "A state with a large state university wanted to compare the incoming SAT verbal scores of males and females. It randomly sampled $36$ female students and $30$ male students and found their scores. The females had an average of $578$ with a standard deviation of $32$. The males had an average of $568$ with a standard deviation of $30$.\nAssuming no technology is available, write the formula for the margin of error of this two-sample $t$-interval of two means with a confidence level of $95\\%$.",
