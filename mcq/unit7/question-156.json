It randomly sampled $36$ female students and $30$ male students and found their scores. The females had an average of $578$ with a standard deviation of $32$. The males had an average of $568$ with a standard deviation of $30$.\nAssuming no technology is available, write the formula for the margin of error of this two-sample $t$-interval of two means with a confidence level of $95\\%$.<br>Assuming no technology is available, write the formula for the margin of error of this two-sample $t$-interval of two means with a confidence level of $95\\%$.",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe formula for the margin of error for a two-sample $t$ interval of two means is\n\n$$t^{*}\\sqrt{\\dfrac{s_{1}^{2}}{n_{1}}+\\dfrac{s^{2}_{2}}{n_{2}}}$$\n\n...where $t^{*}$ is the critical value, the $s$ values are the standard deviations of the two samples, and the $n$ values are the sample sizes.\n\nFirst, we fill in our standard deviation values and our sample size values under the square root sign. The critical value is more complicated. While it is generally accepted to simply use technology, using Table B you would use the smaller of the $n-1$ values to get the degrees of freedom. In this case, the smaller sample is $30$, so the degrees of freedom would be $30-1=29$. On the $29$ line, you would then look at the $95\\%$ column to find the value $2.045$.\n\n$$2.045\\sqrt{\\dfrac{32^{2}}{36}+\\dfrac{30^{2}}{30}}$$\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because the values of $s$ did not get squared.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because it uses a d.f. of $30$ instead of $29$ to obtain the wrong critical value.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because in the first fraction the two variables are reversed.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because the degrees of freedom are essentially ignored here and the $z^{*}$ value of $1.960$ is used instead.",
