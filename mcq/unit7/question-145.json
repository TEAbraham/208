Jimmy has averaged $56.2$ seconds with a standard deviation of $1.3$ seconds, while Bobby has averaged $55.8$ seconds with a standard deviation of $1.3$ seconds. Bobby asked the coach to perform a two-sample T-test to determine if he is significantly better than Jimmy this year.<br>What conclusion does the coach make?",
