  "question_text": "Suppose Jimmy and Bobby are two long-time competitors on the same track team in the $400$ -meter dash. Jimmy and Bobby have ran $10$ races this year. Jimmy has averaged $56.2$ seconds with a standard deviation of $1.3$ seconds, while Bobby has averaged $55.8$ seconds with a standard deviation of $1.3$ seconds. Bobby asked the coach to perform a two-sample T-test to determine if he is significantly better than Jimmy this year. What conclusion does the coach make?",
