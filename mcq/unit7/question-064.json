  "question_text": "Suppose a psychologist decides to use a matched pairs (paired) experiment to determine how long individuals can hold their hands in ice water when intoxicated compared to sober. Suppose the psychologist hypothesizes that alcohol will numb the pain, so individuals will be able to keep their hands in the ice water longer when intoxicated. If the longest amount of time was $5.1\\text{ minutes}$ , what are the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this situation?",
