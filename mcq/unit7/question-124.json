  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Today, poles used for pole-vaulting are usually made of fiberglass and carbon fiber. A sporting goods company has developed a pole made from a new composite material and they believe that using this pole will allow vaulters to reach greater heights. They plan to conduct a study involving a sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$30$</span> experienced pole-vaulters.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Each pole-vaulter will be given <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> attempts to vault with a traditional pole made of fiberglass and carbon fiber, and their highest vault will be recorded. At a different time, each pole-vaulter will also be given <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> attempts to vault with a pole made of the new material and their highest vault will be recorded. Which pole is used first will be randomly determined.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">For each pole-vaulter, researchers will also record the difference between their highest vault using the new pole and their highest vault using the traditional pole (New – Traditional).  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">After verifying that the necessary conditions are satisfied, researchers plan to conduct a test.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What are the appropriate hypotheses?</div>",
