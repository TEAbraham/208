  "question_text": "Fantasy football consists of a competition where participants select players from different football teams and points are awarded based on the performance of those players. A student was curious if the fantasy football totals for quarterbacks from the first $3\\text{ weeks}$ of the season was a good indicator of how well players would do the rest of the season.<br>The student randomly sampled $21$ starting quarterbacks and measured their average fantasy football points for the first 3 weeks, and sampled another random sample of $21$ quarterbacks and measured their average fantasy football points for the remainder of the season. The student then ran a 2 sample $T$-test to determine if the number of fantasy football points in the first $3\\text{ weeks}$ of the season differed from the fantasy football points the rest of the year.<br>The data is shown below: Mean (first 3 weeks) = $23.92$ Standard Deviation (first 3 weeks) = $10.20$<br>Mean (remainder of the season) = $18.30$ Standard Deviation (remainder of the season) = $9.20$<br>After running a two-sided test, a $P$-value of $6.83\\%$ was calculated.<br>How might you interpret the $P$-value in the context of the problem?",
