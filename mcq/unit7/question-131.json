  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Fantasy football consists of a competition where participants select players from different football teams and points are awarded based on the performance of those players.  A student was curious if the fantasy football totals for quarterbacks from the first <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$3\\text{ weeks}$</span> of the season was a good indicator of how well players would do the rest of the season.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">The student randomly sampled <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$21$</span> starting quarterbacks and measured their average fantasy football points for the first 3 weeks, and sampled another random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$21$</span> quarterbacks and measured their average fantasy football points for the remainder of the season.  The student then ran a 2 sample <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$T$</span>-test to determine if the number of fantasy football points in the first <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$3\\text{ weeks}$</span> of the season differed from the fantasy football points the rest of the year.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">The data is shown below:\nMean (first 3 weeks) = <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$23.92$</span>\nStandard Deviation (first 3 weeks) = <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10.20$</span></div><div class=\"paragraph\">Mean (remainder of the season) = <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$18.30$</span>\nStandard Deviation (remainder of the season) = <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$9.20$</span></div><div class=\"paragraph\">After running a two-sided test, a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$P$</span>-value of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$6.83\\%$</span> was calculated.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">How might you interpret the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$P$</span>-value in the context of the problem?</div>",
