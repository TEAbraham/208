  "solution": "Solution\n\nVery rarely will a sample mean equal the population mean, due to sampling variability. Therefore, the accountant's sample is simply a statistic because it describes the sample. Since we do not know the standard deviation, we cannot use the normal distribution to find the probability of the sample happening, if the population mean is correct.\n\nTherefore, the accountant is unable to make the claim that the IRS made is incorrect.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The sample size is $30$, which is large enough to meet the Central Limit Theorem and definitely meets the $10\\%$ condition as well.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Although the population is not stated as Normal, the sampling distribution would be Normal because the Central Limit Theorem is met.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Even if the data has an outlier, the Central Limit Theorem is met, therefore the sampling distribution is approaching Normality.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This statement is incorrect. In fact, since the sample is random, we are allowed to generalize for the population.",
