  "solution": "Very rarely will a sample mean equal the population mean, due to <em>sampling variability</em>. Therefore, the accountant's sample is simply a <em>statistic</em> because it describes the sample. Since we do not know the standard deviation, we cannot use the normal distribution to find the probability of the sample happening, if the population mean is correct. \n\nTherefore, the accountant is unable to make the claim that the IRS made is incorrect. \n\n<strong>Choice 'A'</strong> is correct.
