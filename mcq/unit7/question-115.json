  "question_text": "Two brands of ice cream which claim to sell quart-sized containers were examined by the ice cream industry to compare the weights of their ice cream. Thirty-seven random quarts of Barry & Jen's Ice Cream were taken and found to have a mean weight of $32.3$ ounces with a standard deviation of $0.8$ ounces. Creyer's Ice Cream had $39$ quarts randomly sampled and these were found to have a mean weight of $31.8$ ounces with a standard deviation of $0.7$ ounces.<br>Calculate a $98\\%$ confidence interval for the difference of the mean weights (B & J's minus Creyer's) and do this using $60$ degrees of freedom. Then, state whether one brand of quart ice creams is bigger than the other or whether they are not statistically different based on your confidence interval.",
