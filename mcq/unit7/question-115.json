  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Two brands of ice cream which claim to sell quart-sized containers were examined by the ice cream industry to compare the weights of their ice cream.  Thirty-seven random quarts of Barry &amp; Jen's Ice Cream were taken and found to have a mean weight of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$32.3$</span> ounces with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.8$</span> ounces.  Creyer's Ice Cream had <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$39$</span> quarts randomly sampled and these were found to have a mean weight of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$31.8$</span> ounces with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.7$</span> ounces.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Calculate a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$98\\%$</span> confidence interval for the difference of the mean weights (B &amp; J's minus Creyer's) and do this using <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$60$</span> degrees of freedom.  Then, state whether one brand of quart ice creams is  bigger than the other or whether they are not statistically different based on your confidence interval.</div>",
