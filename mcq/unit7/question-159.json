The analyst working with the data came out with a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$95\\%$</span> confidence interval of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$(-2.10, 0.30)$</span>.  She wondered that if the study was run again, what the effects of sample size would be? </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of the following would decrease the width of the confidence interval <em>and</em> show more clearly that one diet program produced more weight loss than the other (assuming all other values remained the same)?</div>",
