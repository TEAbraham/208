  "question_text": "A company was curious as to the ratings of one of its products by age group. It asked two randomly chosen groups of $32$ of its customers, one group under age $40$ and the other group over age $40$, to give its product a ranking between $1$ and $10$. These people were chosen from a customer list which included $210$ customers under age $40$ and $360$ customers over age $40$. In the under $40$ group the average ranking was $5.7$ with a standard deviation of $1.2$. In the older group the average ranking was $6.3$ with a standard deviation of $1.4$.<br>Are the conditions for calculating a two-sample confidence interval for estimating the difference of two population means met in the example above?",

      "text": "No. The samples of $32$ people are two small. Each group should be larger in order to avoid the possibility of skewness in the distributions."
    },
    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "No. The problem is that the size of the sample in the under age $40$ group is too large for the size of its population. A sample of $32$ people would require a population of $320$ or more people, and here it is only $210$."
