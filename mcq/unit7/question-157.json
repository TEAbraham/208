It asked two randomly chosen groups of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$32$</span> of its customers, one group under age <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> and the other group over age <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span>, to give its product a ranking between <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1$</span> and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10$</span>.  These people were chosen from a customer list which included <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$210$</span> customers under age <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$360$</span> customers over age <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span>.  In the under <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> group the average ranking was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5.7$</span> with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1.2$</span>.  In the older group the average ranking was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$6.3$</span> with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1.4$</span>. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Are the conditions for calculating a two-sample confidence interval for estimating the difference of two population means met in the example above?</div>",
