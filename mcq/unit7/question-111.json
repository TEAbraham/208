  "question_text": "A study on womenâ€™s weights was recently completed. Fifteen randomly selected high school females from an urban setting were compared to $16$ randomly selected high school females from a rural setting. Assume that the distribution of both populations are approximately normal. The results are below: Two-Sample T for Urban Weights vs. Rural Weights N Mean StDev SE Mean Urban Weights 15 126.1 10.5 2.7 Rural Weights 16 128.8 13.2 3.3 $\\text{Difference }= \\mu \\text{(Urban Weights)} - \\mu \\text{(Rural Weights)}$ Estimate for difference: $-2.68$ $95\\%$ confidence interval for difference: ( $-11.45, 6.09$ ) $\\text{T-test of difference }= 0$ $\\text{T-value }= -0.63$ $\\text{P-value }= 0.537$ $\\text{DF }= 28$ What conclusions can be made on rural versus urban weights based on the confidence interval above?",
