  "solution": "The hypothesis will always be based off the population, never the sample. Therefore, the sample mean of $\\$183{,}482$ should not be used in either hypothesis.\n\nThe population mean is still either $\\$175{,}000$ or possibly higher this year.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
