  "question_text": "Camden was asked by one of his friends how many tweets he sends out a day. Not knowing the exact answer, Camden randomly selected $16$ days from the past and looked at the number of tweets he sent out. Using his knowledge and AP Statistical power, he decided to construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the average number of tweets he sent out. The data he collected from the $16$ days followed an approximately normal distribution with a mean of $3.14$ and standard deviation of $0.68$ . Which of the following represents a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the average number of tweets Camden sends out a day?",
