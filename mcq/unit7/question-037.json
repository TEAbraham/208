  "solution": "Anytime the entire interval is above what is being tested ($0$, in this case), it evidences an increase.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; this gives close to a correct interpretation, but it is more specific to say there really is an increase if the entire interval is above $0$.\n\nChoices 'B', 'D', and 'E' are incorrect; having the $p$-value or test statistic in the interval has no meaning whatsoever.",
