  "question_text": "An exercise physiologist is interested in the effect of exercise on heart rate. She has subjects walk slowly for $5\\text{ minutes}$ and records their heart rates. Then she has the subjects run vigorously for $5\\text{ minutes}$ and records their heart rates again. The differences are recorded (heart rate after running - heart rate before running), with results below: One-Sample T: Differences Test of $\\mu$ = $0$ vs. > $0$ Variable N Mean StDev SE Mean 96% CI T P Differences 12 59.88 10.36 3.66 (51.22, 68.53) 16.35 0.000 What is a valid interpretation of the confidence interval given from the computer output?",
