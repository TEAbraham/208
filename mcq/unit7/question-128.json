  "solution": "When it is known that variances are equal, one could pool the variances to get:\n\n$${ { n }_{ 1 } }-1+{ { n }_{ 2 } }-1 = 24+16 = 40$$\n\n...degrees of freedom.\n\nHowever, in this situation it is not known that the variances are equal, so the most conservative approach must be used. This consists of $n-1$ degrees of freedom for the smaller sample: $17-1 = 16$ degrees of freedom.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
