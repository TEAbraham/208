  "question_text": "A high school athletic director was interested whether high school males are more likely to compete in sports than high school females are.<br>He randomly sampled $200$ high school males across the country and found that $82$ of them participated in at least one high school sport at some point during the year. This compares to $68$ out of $200$ randomly sampled high school females who participated in at least one sport during the year.<br>Suppose you define $p_{1}$ as the proportion of high school males who participated in at least one sport over the last year and $p_{2}$ as the proportion of high school females who competed in at least one sport in the last year.<br>What would be the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When setting up hypotheses for a two-proportion Z-test, the data from the survey never factors into the hypothesis set up.\n\nThe null hypothesis will always be p1=p2.\n\nIn this case, the alternative is p1>p2 because the problem states the athletic director wishes to see if a higher percentage of males participate than do females.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
