She started to wonder if the percent of students who enroll in college immediately after completing high school is now greater than <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$65.9\\%$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">To investigate, she contacted <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$437$</span>  students (some from her school and some from other schools) that she knew would be graduating this year.  She found that <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$80.3\\%$</span> of them were planning to enroll in college immediately after completing high school.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">If Wendy is willing to consider that all conditions have been satisfied, which of the following shows how to calculate the standard deviation of the proportion for the appropriate statistical test? </div>",
