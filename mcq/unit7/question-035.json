  "solution": "Solution\n\nSince this is a mean with an unknown standard deviation, we are dealing with a one-sample $t$-interval. To find the critical value ($t^*$) for a one-sample $t$-interval, you need to find where the confidence level and degrees of freedom (D.O.F) intersect on the $t$-chart.\n\nIn this case, we find where the $90\\%$ confidence level and the D.O.F. of $19$ intersect. The $19$ D.O.F. comes from $n-1$, where $n$ is the sample size, so in this case $20-1=19$. We find that they intersect at $1.729$.\n\nAlternative Method\n\nAn alternative approach to doing this is using the TI-84. On the TI-84:\n\nPress 2nd Vars\nSelect invT\nEnter $0.95$ ($90\\%$ central area + $5\\%$ of the area on the left tail) and the D.O.F. of $19$\nPress Enter\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because the critical value of $1.734$ represents a $90$% confidence with $18$ degrees of freedom.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because the critical value of $1.725$ represents a $90$% confidence with $20$ degrees of freedom.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the critical value of $1.721$ represents a $90$% confidence with $21$ degrees of freedom.\n\nChoice 'E' represents the critical value of a $z$-interval with $90$% confidence. This is not a $z$-interval, since the population standard deviation is unknown.",
