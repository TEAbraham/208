  "question_text": "A spokesman for a large cereal company is interested in whether a new promotion of including a toy in every box of cereal would greatly increase sales.<br>He figures that age would be a factor, so he selects one pair of subjects at each age range from $10$ to $79$ by increments of $5\\text{ years}$.<br>The spokesman flips a coin to decide which of the pair gets a coupon for a free prize every time they buy a box of the cereal. After one year, each subject is asked how many boxes of that brand of cereal they bought.<br>The data is in the table below (scroll right to see full table):<br>From this data, is there convincing statistical evidence that people buy more cereal when a prize coupon is included?<br>From this data, is there convincing statistical evidence that people buy more cereal when a prize coupon is included?",

  "solution": "This is a single sample $T$-test where the single sample being taken is the difference between the two age ranges. For example, the first data point to be used is $9-7 = 2$.\n\nThe $14$ data points are $2, 4, 0, -1, -1, 5, 6, 6, 2, 0, 1, 1, 0$, and $1$.\n\nPut these data points into your calculator or statistical software package and run a one-sample $T$-test of $H_0: \\mu = 0$ against $H_a: \\mu > 0$, where $\\mu$ represents the difference in sales with the prize and without.\n\nThe test results in a test statistic of $t = 2.84$ and $p = 0.0069$.\n\nWith a low $p$-value, there is evidence at the $1\\%$, $5\\%$, and $10\\%$ levels that people who get the coupon for a free prize buy more cereal.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
