  "question_text": "For an AP Statistics project, a student named Joe was curious as to the average math SAT scores of students at his school. He chose $30$ seniors at random and found an average SAT math score of $542$ with a standard deviation of $81$. He wanted to construct a $99\\%$ confidence interval. Find the margin of error for that interval.",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe margin of error for this one-sample t interval uses the formula:\n\n$$t^{*}\\dfrac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$$\n\n...where $t^{*}$ is the critical value based on the degrees of freedom taken from Table B, where degrees of freedom is equal to $n-1$, $n$ is the sample size, and $s$ is the sample standard deviation. The term $\\dfrac{s}{\\sqrt{n}}$ is known as the standard error.\n\nIn this problem, we have $30-1=29$ degrees of freedom (d.f.). In Table B, using the $99\\%$ column as given in the prompt, the critical value is $2.756$. The sample size is given as $30$, and the sample standard deviation is given as $81$.\n\nThus, our margin of error is equal to $2.756\\lgroup\\dfrac{81}{\\sqrt{30}}\\rgroup$ which has a value of $40.76$.\n\nSo, Choice 'C'is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because the t∗ value is wrong. It was taken using a d.f. of 30 instead of 29.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because the t∗ value is wrong. This time, the 95% column was used in error.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the n and s values are reversed.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because an incorrect value of t∗\nis used. In addition, the square root sign was omitted.",
