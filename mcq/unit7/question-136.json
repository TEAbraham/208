  "solution": "A small $p$-value ($p = 0$) and a test statistic far from zero ($t = 16.35$) gives evidence that heart rate goes up.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; although the average increase was $59.88$ (near $60$), a hypothesis test cannot determine how much the increase is; it will tell us only that there either is an increase or there is not.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; a sample size of $n = 12$ is not optimal but is not a significant cause for concern.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; there is nothing in the problem that shows clear bias. The fact that this is a paired experiment makes it less worrisome that this may not be an SRS.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; a low p-value does give us evidence of an increase in heart rate in this situation.",
