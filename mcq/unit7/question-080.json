  "solution": "The value in the upper tail to the right of $z = 1.71$ is $1 â€“ 0.9564 = 0.0436$. Since this is a two-sided alternative, you must consider that you were unsure of the experimental result; it could also have occurred in the left tail of the $z$-curve.\n\nThus, the probability calculated must be doubled in order to report the correct $p$-value:\n\n$0.0436 \\cdot 2 = 0.0872$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
