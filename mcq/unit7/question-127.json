  "question_text": "A statistics teacher wants to see if there is a difference in the mean time needed to wait for an Uber ride in two different metropolitan areas.<br>Twenty-five randomly selected times are accessed during the day for each area. The mean time waiting for an Uber in the first area is $8.3\\text{ minutes}$ with a standard deviation of $1.1\\text{ minutes}$, followed by the second area having a mean Uber wait time of $8.9\\text{ minutes}$ with a standard deviation of $1.3\\text{ minutes}$.<br>Assuming the conditions for inference are met, which of the following statements is true?",
