  "question_text": "A gardener wishes to determine which of two different potato plants gives the highest yield (in terms of pounds per plant).<br>In a large field, $15$ plants of variety A were planted in random locations. In a different large field, $15$ plants of variety B were planted in random locations.<br>Variety A averaged $56.43\\text{ pounds per plant}$, with a standard deviation of $0.1\\text{ pounds}$, and variety B averaged $56.53\\text{ pounds per plant}$ with a standard deviation of $0.14\\text{ pounds}$. When performing a two-sample $T$-test on this data, the $p$-value was $0.033$.<br>Which of the following statements is/are true concerning the interpretation of these results?<br>I. These results cannot be trusted, as randomization was not properly used in this context.<br>II. These results may not be useful, as the difference is so small.<br>III. These results may not be useful, as it is likely that the sampling distribution will not be approximately normal.",
