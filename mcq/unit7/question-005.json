  "question_text": "A large car company is wondering if the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (MPG) would improve if they use a new tire on their mid-size SUV. The company selects a random sample of $70$ mid-size SUVs and assigns half of them to tire $1$, the new tire, and the other half to tire $2$, the old tire. After running trials on the SUVs, the company finds the average fuel efficiency for tire $1$ to be $25.6$ mpg and the average fuel efficiency for tire $2$ to be $24.3$ mpg.<br>Does the company have evidence to continue investigating if the new tire improves gas mileage?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nTo investigate if the new tires actually improve miles per gallon, the company first needs to see if the average miles per gallon is different between the two types of tires. In this scenario, tire $1$ has an average fuel efficiency of $25.6$ mpg, while tire $2$ has an average fuel efficiency of $24.3$ mpg. If we were to find the difference between the new tire and the old tire, we would get $25.6 - 24.3 = 1.3$ mpg.\n\nTherefore, since there is a positive difference between the two brands of tires, the company should continue its investigation to see if there is a difference between the two brands of tires.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. Knowing that the sample sizes are at least $30$ would allow us to state the two different sampling distributions were approximately normal, but would not be able to state if there was a difference or not.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Since we will find the difference between tire $1$ and tire $2$, as shown above, the difference is positive. This shows that there is a difference between the two sample means.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. A difference in the sample data, regardless of how small, is evidence that the company should continue its investigation into the two different tire brands.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Even though the population size is unknown, we can still continue the investigation with small evidence, such as a positive difference between the two sample means.",
