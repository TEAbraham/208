  "solution": "When introducing statistics, it is important to examine <strong>random</strong> and <strong>non-random</strong> patterns. Patterns in data will help us answer questions about a set of data. Even when data seems to be random or non-random, the presence of a pattern does not imply a random or non-random pattern. \n\nEven though the groups ended up being all males and all females, since the researcher used a chance process, the groups are still considered to be random. Albeit a small probability, but using a chance process can still lead to non-random looking groups. \n\n<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is correct. ",
  "distractor_explanations": {
    "A": "<strong>Choice 'A'</strong> is incorrect. There is a non-zero probability of getting all males and all females in the groups, even if it's very small. ",
    "B": "<strong>Choice 'B'</strong> is incorrect. Although very slim, there does exist a probability of getting no males and no females in the groups, so we are not guaranteed one gender in each group. ",
    "C": "<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is incorrect. Although a coin is two-sided, it does not guarantee that each group will have half male and half female. ",
    "E": "<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is incorrect.
