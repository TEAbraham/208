  "question_text": "Alex likes to play Trivia Triumph, an online trivia game. In this game, trivia questions are presented and players have up to $30$ seconds to select an answer from a list of $5$ choices. Each question starts at a point value of $300$ points, but $10$ points are deducted for each second it takes the player to answer the question. Therefore, the number of points, $P$, that a player earns on a single question can be described by the following equation<br>$$P=300-10S$$<br>... where $S$ represents the number of seconds it takes the player to select an answer.<br>Whether he knows the answer to a question or not, Alex tends to answer in about the same amount of time. His online statistics shows that the mean amount of time it takes him to answer a question, ${\\mu}_{S}$ is $13.4$ seconds with a variance of $5.29$ seconds.<br>What is the standard deviation of the number of points Alex earns when he gets a question correct?",

  "solution": "The number of seconds it takes Alex to answer a question is a random variable, $S$. The number of points he earns, $P$, is also a random variable. We are looking for the variance of $P$, and $P$ is a linear transformation of $S$. The transformation is described by the given equation:\n\n$$P=300-10S$$\n\nFrom this equation, we see that $S$ is multiplied by $-10$ and added to $300$. While multiplication affects both standard deviation and variance, addition does not affect either.\n\nWe are given ${ \\sigma }_{ S }^{ 2 }$, the variance of $S$. Find the standard deviation of $S$, ${\\sigma}_{S}$, by taking the square root of the reported variance.\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ S }=\\sqrt { { \\sigma }_{ S }^{ 2 } } $$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ S }=\\sqrt { 5.29 } $$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ S }=2.3$$\n\nThen, find the standard deviation of $P$, by multiplying the standard deviation of $S$ by $10$. We would not multiply by $-10$ because we know that standard deviation cannot be negative.\n\n$${\\sigma}_{P}=10{\\sigma}_{S}$$\n\n$${\\sigma}_{P}=10(2.3)$$\n\n$${\\sigma}_{P}=23$$\n\nWe could also have approached this problem by working with the variance. Since the variance of $S$ is $5.29$, the variance of $P$ can be found as follows:\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ P }^{ 2 }={ \\left( -10 \\right) }^{ 2 }\\bullet { \\sigma }_{ S }^{ 2 }$$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ P }^{ 2 }=100(5.29)$$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ P }^{ 2 }=529$$\n\nThen, the standard deviation can be found by taking the square root.\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ P }=\\sqrt { { \\sigma }_{ SP}^{ 2 } } $$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ P }=\\sqrt { 529 } $$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ P }=23$$\n\nChoice 'B' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. There are two mistakes here. The first mistake is in transforming the variance by multiplying by $-10$. The second mistake comes with not realizing that standard deviation (or variance) cannot be negative.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Here, the variance was multiplied by $10$, perhaps in recognition of the fact that standard deviation (or variance) cannot be negative. However, this value does not represent the standard deviation.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Standard deviation is not affected by adding a constant. Only the fact that $S$ was multiplied by $-10$ has any effect on the standard deviation.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and represents the variance of $P$.",
