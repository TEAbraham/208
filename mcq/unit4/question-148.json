  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Alex likes to play Trivia Triumph, an online trivia game.  In this game, trivia questions are presented and players have up to <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$30$</span> seconds to select an answer from a list of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> choices.  Each question starts at a point value of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$300$</span> points, but <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10$</span> points are deducted for each second it takes the player to answer the question.  Therefore, the number of points, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$P$</span>, that a player earns on a single question can be described by the following equation    </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><div class=\"tex2jax_process\">$$P=300-10S$$</div>  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">... where <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$S$</span> represents the number of seconds it takes the player to select an answer.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Whether he knows the answer to a question or not, Alex tends to answer in about the same amount of time.  His online statistics shows that the mean amount of time it takes him to answer a question, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">${\\mu}_{S}$</span> is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$13.4$</span> seconds with a variance of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5.29$</span> seconds.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What is the standard deviation of the number of points Alex earns when he gets a question correct?</div>",
