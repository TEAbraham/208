  "solution": "We are dealing with a linear transformation.\n\nSince the median is measure of center, the new median will be:\n\n$$3X-7$$\n\n$$=(3)(10)-7$$\n\n$$=23$$\n\nSince the IQR is a measure of spread, the new IQR will be:\n\n$$3X$$\n\n$$=(3)(40)$$\n\n$$=120$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect as the IQR gets affected by multiplication and not subtraction.\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect as the IQR will not get subtracted by $7$.\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect as the median will get subtracted by $7$, but the IQR will not.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect as the median will get subtracted by $7$.",
