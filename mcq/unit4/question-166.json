  "solution": "It correctly uses the binomial formula:\n\nP(x)=\\dbinom{n}{x}{ \\pi }^{ x }{ (1-\\pi ) }^{ n-x }\n\nIn this case, n = 8 (the total number of occurrences), x = 5 (the occurrences we are trying to find the probability for) and \\pi = 0.5 (the probability of occurrence x).\n\nWhile this formula is given on the AP test, one can think of it logically. In order to get 5\\text{ heads} out of 8\\text{ tosses}, one needs to get:\n\n\\dbinom{8}{5}=\\dfrac{8!}{5!\\cdot 3!}\n\nTherefore, all 3\\text{ elements} need to be part of the solution. Since multiplication is commutative, these three elements can be in any order.\n\nNote: 8! = (8)\\cdot(7)\\cdot(6)\\cdot(5)\\cdot(4)\\cdot(3)\\cdot(2)\\cdot(1)",
