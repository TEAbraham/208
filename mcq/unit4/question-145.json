  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\"><em>Don't Worry, Bee Happy</em> is a store that sells artisanal honey.  One of their best sellers is Wild Wildflower Honey, packaged in glass jars that are labeled as containing <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8\\text{ ounces}$</span> of honey.  The owners want to make very sure that their customers are happy however, so the actual mean amount of honey contained in the jars is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8.05\\text{ ounces}$</span>.  And while production standards are tight, not all jars contain exactly <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8.05\\text{ ounces}$</span>.  In fact, the standard deviation is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.09\\text{ ounces}$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">For true lovers of Wild Wildflower Honey (and for those looking for a more economical way to purchase several jars), the store offers a special <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$3$</span>-pack consisting of three individual <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8\\text{ ounce}$</span> jars of Wild Wildflower Honey.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Since knowing the actual weight of one jar of honey will tell you nothing about the actual weight of another jar of honey, the weights of all <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$3$</span> jars in the pack would be considered independent.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of the following shows how to calculate the variance of the number of ounces of honey in the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$3$</span>-pack? </div>",
