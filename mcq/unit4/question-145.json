  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "Don't Worry, Bee Happy is a store that sells artisanal honey. One of their best sellers is Wild Wildflower Honey, packaged in glass jars that are labeled as containing $8\\text{ ounces}$ of honey. The owners want to make very sure that their customers are happy however, so the actual mean amount of honey contained in the jars is $8.05\\text{ ounces}$. And while production standards are tight, not all jars contain exactly $8.05\\text{ ounces}$. In fact, the standard deviation is $0.09\\text{ ounces}$.<br>For true lovers of Wild Wildflower Honey (and for those looking for a more economical way to purchase several jars), the store offers a special $3$-pack consisting of three individual $8\\text{ ounce}$ jars of Wild Wildflower Honey.<br>Since knowing the actual weight of one jar of honey will tell you nothing about the actual weight of another jar of honey, the weights of all $3$ jars in the pack would be considered independent.<br>Which of the following shows how to calculate the variance of the number of ounces of honey in the $3$-pack?",

  "solution": "The amount of honey in one jar is a random variable that we could call $H$. We are told the standard deviation of $H$ is ${ \\sigma }_{ H }=0.09$.\n\nTo find the variance of $H$, we simply need to square the standard deviation. That is:\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ H }^{ 2 }={ \\left( 0.09 \\right) }^{ 2 }$$\n\nWe are looking for the variance of $H + H +H$. Since the weight of each jar of honey is independent from the weight of another jar, we can find the combined variance by simply adding the individual variances. That is:\n\n$${ (0.09) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.09) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.09) }^{ 2 }$$\n\nSince $3\\cdot { \\left( 0.09 \\right) }^{ 2 }$ is the same as ${ (0.09) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.09) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.09) }^{ 2 }$, Choice 'A' does provide a correct method for finding the combined variance.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because it attempts to find the combined variance by using transformations of random variables rather than simply adding the individual variances. While $H + H + H$ is algebraically equivalent to $3H$, the following calculations do not accurately find the combined variance.\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ 3H }^{ 2 }={ \\left( 3 \\right) }^{ 2 }\\cdot { \\sigma }_{ H }^{ 2 }$$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ 3H }^{ 2 }={ \\left( 3 \\right) }^{ 2 }\\cdot { \\left( 0.09 \\right) }^{ 2 }$$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ 3H }^{ 2 }={ \\left[ \\left( 3 \\right) \\cdot \\left( 0.09 \\right) \\right] }^{ 2 }$$\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because the number of jars of honey was squared, rather than the standard deviation.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and probably represents a pure guess. There would be no logical reason to add the constant to the standard deviation and then square the result.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because it represents the standard deviation of the three jars of honey - not the variance.",
