  "solution": "We must first find the $z$-score associated with a bag weight of $12.5\\text{ ounces}$. The formula for calculating $z$ is:\n\n$$z=\\dfrac { x-\\mu }{ \\sigma }$$\n\n...where $x$ is the observed value, $\\mu $ is the mean, and $\\sigma $ is the standard deviation of the distribution.\n\nFilling in this formula we get:\n\n$$z=\\dfrac { 12.5-12.14 }{ 0.22 } =1.636$$\n\nNow we can find the probability of a single bag weighing more than $12.5\\text{ ounces}$ by finding $p(z > 1.636)$. The easiest way to do this is by using your TI83/84 calculator's normalcdf function.\n\nThe syntax is: normalcdf(lower bound, upper bound, mean, standard deviation). Since we are working with a $z$-score, the mean is $0$ and standard deviation is $1$. There is no upper bound, so we will use $10^{99}$ as the upper bound to ensure that our answer is quite accurate. Using your calculator:\n\nPress $2nd$\nPress VARS (DISTR)\nChoose $2$ (normalcdf)\nEnter $1.636, { 10 }^{ 99 }, 0, 1$\nEnter\n\nThe calculator will return the probability of $0.051$. This, however, is the probability of one single bag weighing more than $12.5\\text{ ounces}$.\n\nTo find the probability that two independent bags weigh more that $12.5\\text{ ounces}$, we must use the multiplication rule for independent events. This rule says:\n\n$$p(A\\cap B)=p(A)\\cdot p(B)$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$p(\\text{greater than }12.5 oz.\\cap \\text{ greater than} 12.5 oz.)=(0.051)\\cdot (0.051) = 0.003$$\n\nNote: We could also use the $z$-table provided with the AP Exam to determine the probability of a single bag weighing more than $12.5\\text{ ounces}$. To do so, we would first need to round our calculated $z$-score to $1.64$. Then, using the table, look down the first column until you find $z = 1.6$.\n\nLook across the corresponding row until it intersects with the column labeled $0.04$. Here you will find the value $0.9495$ which represents $p(z < 1.64)$. Since we want $p(z > 1.64)$ we would subtract this value from $1$. Then $p(z > 1.64 ) = 1 - 0.9495 = 0.0505$ or about $0.051$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This answer would be correct if the problem asked for the probability that the average weight of the two bags was greater than $12.5\\text{ ounces}$. It represents,\n\n$$p\\left( z > \\dfrac { 12.5-12.14 }{ \\dfrac { 0.22 }{ \\sqrt { 2 } } } \\right) $$\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This represents the probability of one bag being greater than $12.5\\text{ ounces}$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This probability was arrived at by multiplying $0.051$ by $2$ or by adding $0.051 + 0.051$. This is not the correct way to find the probability of obtaining two bags weighing more than $12.5\\text{ ounces}$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This value is the standard deviation of the distribution.",
