  "solution": "In this situation, the probably of success is not quite independent: once a winner is picked, future success is less likely.\n\nThe probability of winning by the third ticket is the sum of the following probabilities:\n\nP(winner by first ticket) =\n75\n300\n\nP(winner by second ticket) =\n225\n300\n×\n75\n299\n\nP(winner by third ticket) =\n225\n300\n×\n224\n299\n×\n75\n298\n\nThe sum of these probabilities is 0.579538.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
