  "question_text": "Sam has been studying really hard for both the A. P. Calculus exam and the A. P. Statistics exam. He feels very confident that he will get either a $4$ or $5$ on the Statistics exam and that he will get at least a $3$ on the Calculus exam. Sam has estimated the joint probabilities associated with the two exams and his estimates are shown in the table below.\nA.P. Calculus\nScores 5 4 3\nA.P. Statistics 5 0.3 0.2 0.1\n4 0.2 0.1 0.1\n\n\nBased on these probabilities, are the scores that Sam will achieve on the two exams independent? Why or why not?",
