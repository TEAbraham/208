  "solution": "Start from the assumption that the individual surveyed answered either \"beach\" or \"cruise\". These responses represent a given condition which limits the sample space to $55+41+19+11$ or $126$ responses. Of these $126$ responses, $55+19$ or $74$ were from women.\n\nTherefore, if the response was either \"beach\" or \"cruise\", the probability that the individual being surveyed was a woman is:\n\n$$\\dfrac{55+19}{55+41+19+11}=\\dfrac{74}{126}=\\dfrac{37}{63}$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and represents the probability that an individual who was surveyed answered either \"beach\" or \"cruise\".\n\n$$\\dfrac{55+41+19+11}{180+180}=\\dfrac{126}{360}=\\dfrac{7}{20}$$\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect and provides the probability that the individual surveyed was a man given that they said either \"beach\" or \"cruise\".\n\n$$\\dfrac{41+11}{55+41+19+11}=\\dfrac{52}{126}=\\dfrac{26}{63}$$\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect and represents the probability that a woman who was surveyed said either \"beach\" or \"cruise\".\n\n$$\\dfrac{55+19}{55+26+33+17+21+9+19}=\\dfrac{74}{180}=\\dfrac{37}{90}$$\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and represents the probability that someone who answered either \"beach\" or \"mountains\" was a woman.\n\n$$\\dfrac{55+26}{55+41+26+35}=\\dfrac{81}{157}$$",
