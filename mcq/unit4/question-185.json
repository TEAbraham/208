  "solution": "This provides the correct formulas for the mean and variance of a binomial distribution.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; this gives the correct mean and the variance for a proportion of successes, not the number of successes.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; this also gives the mean for a proportion of successes, not the number of successes.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; this selection gives the standard deviation formula for a sample mean, not binomial.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; this selection gives the mean for a sample mean, and it is also incorrect as it gives the standard deviation, not variance, for binomial.",
