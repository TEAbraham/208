  "question_text": "In the $200$ meter medley relay, four different swimmers each swim $200$ meters using one specific swimming stroke. The top girl's relay team from Lakeview High School consists of Abby, Bella, Claudia and Danielle. The following chart shows information about each girl.<br>Their swimming coach believes that if the girls can swim the relay in $1$ minute and $45$ seconds or less, they have a good chance to win states!\nAssuming the distribution of swim times for each girl is approximately normal and that each girl's time is independent of the others, what is the probability they will be able to complete the relay in the necessary time?",
