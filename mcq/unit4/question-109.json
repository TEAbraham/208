  "question_text": "Here is a random variable distribution for the grades Chris has received during $16$ years of schooling.  Chris created this because she thought it would be interesting to use this to possibly predict what will happen in the graduate program she is about to attend.  The random variable, $x$ , stands for grades where an $A$ is $5$ , a $B$ is $4$ , etc. $x$ $1$ $ 2$ $ 3$ $  4 $ $ 5$ $p(x)$ $0.02$ $0.08$ $0.10$ $0.25$ $0.55$ Find the probability that Chris' next grade will not be less than a $B$ .",
