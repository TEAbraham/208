Chris created this because she thought it would be interesting to use this to possibly predict what will happen in the graduate program she is about to attend. The random variable, $x$, stands for grades where an $A$ is $5$, a $B$ is $4$, etc.\n$x$ $1$ $ 2$ $ 3$ $ 4 $ $ 5$\n$p(x)$ $0.02$ $0.08$ $0.10$ $0.25$ $0.55$\nFind the probability that Chris' next grade will not be less than a $B$.",
