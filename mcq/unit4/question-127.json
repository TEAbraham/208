  "solution": "The number of pieces of art that Fannie sells per hour is a random variable that we will call $X$. In order to determine Fannie's average sales total, we must find the mean or expected value of $X$. The formula for calculating the mean of a random variable is:\n\n$${ \\mu }_{ X } = \\sum { \\left( { x }_{ i } \\right) \\left( { p }_{ i } \\right) } = \\left( { x }_{ 1 } \\right) \\left( { p }_{ 1 } \\right) + \\left( { x }_{ 2 } \\right) \\left( { p }_{ 2 } \\right) + ...... +\\left( { x }_{ n } \\right) \\left( { p }_{ n } \\right)$$\n\nSimply fill in the formula:\n\n$${ \\mu }_{ X } = \\left( 6 \\right) \\left( 0.33 \\right) + \\left( 7 \\right) \\left( 0.51 \\right) + \\left( 8 \\right) \\left( 0.12 \\right) + \\left( 9 \\right) \\left( 0.03 \\right) + \\left( 10 \\right) \\left( 0.01 \\right) = 6.88$$\n\nKeep in mind that this is the average number of pieces of art that Fannie will sell per hour. Since it is an average, do not round it to a whole number.\n\nNow we need to determine how much money Fannie will make on average when working $8\\text{ hours}$ at a craft fair. Since she makes $\\$25$ per image we can determine how much she will make on average each hour by multiplying $(6.88)(\\$25) = \\$172$.\n\nNow multiply by $8$ to determine her average income for the duration of the craft fair: $(\\$172)(8) = \\$1376$. Then remember that she has to pay $$200$ to rent space at the craft fair and subtract this from the amount of money she has taken in: $\\$1376 - \\$200 = \\$1176$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. The average number of pieces sold per hour was $6.88$, but there is no reason to multiply this value by $100$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect and results from rounding the average number of pieces sold per hour from $6.88$ to $7$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because it forgets to subtract $\\$200$ for renting space.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and results from assuming that $8$ was the mean number of pieces sold per hour. We cannot find the mean of a random variable by simply averaging all possible values of the random variable.",
