The number of pieces of art that she is able to sell per hour is pretty predictable. The distribution is shown below. # Sold (X) 6 7 8 9 10 P(X) 0.33 0.51 0.12 0.03 0.01 If Fannie sells her art for $\\$25$ per piece, but must pay $\\$200$ to rent space at a craft show, how much on average can she expect to take home from a show that lasts $8\\text{ hours}$ ?",
