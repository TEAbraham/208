  "question_text": "When tennis is played, the game continues until one player has won four points; however, if the game is tied at either three or four points each, the opponents continue until one player wins two points in a row.<br>Suppose Jane and Tom are playing a single tennis game. For any point, the probability that Jane wins that point is $0.6$.<br>Assuming that each point played is independent of every other, what probability model is appropriate for describing this game?",
