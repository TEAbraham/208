  "question_text": "Suppose a local police department decides to track how many minor citations its officers give per month.\nThe mean and standard deviation of the number of citations per month is $84.3$ and $12.6$, respectively. Suppose each citation has an average fee of $\\$115.32$.\nAssuming this distribution is approximately normal and citations are independent, what is the probability that the police department earns more than $\\$125{,}000$ in revenue from minor citations over the course of the next year ($12\\text{ months}$)?",
