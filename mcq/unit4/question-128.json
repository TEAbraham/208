  "question_text": "A science teacher has students measure the mass of their personal science notebooks using the same scale. The resulting mean and standard deviation are $130\\text{ grams}$ and $5\\text{ grams}$, respectively.<br>The teacher later realizes that the scale used by students to measure the notebooks was not calibrated properly. The masses of the notebooks registered as $2\\text{ grams}$ more than they should have been.<br>Without remeasuring all the notebooks, what values should the teacher use for the mean and standard deviation of these values?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When a constant is added to or subtracted from each piece of data, the distribution is simply shifted right or left on the number line. The shape and spread of the distribution are unaffected.\n\nThus, the mean must be shifted $2\\text{ grams}$ to the left, to be centered at $128\\text{ grams}$, but the standard deviation remains unchanged and is still $5\\text{ grams}$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This selection correctly moves the mean down $2\\text{ grams}$, but it also incorrectly moves the standard deviation down $2\\text{ grams}$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This selection correctly moves the mean down $2\\text{ grams}$, but it is incorrect to say the standard deviation cannot be determined. When subtracting a constant from a set of data, the standard deviation will always stay the same, and therefore can be determined\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This selection incorrectly raises the mean by $2\\text{ grams}$, when instead it should be lowered.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This selection incorrectly raises the mean by $2\\text{ grams}$, and it lowers the standard deviation by $2\\text{ grams}$, when in fact the standard deviation should remain unchanged.",
