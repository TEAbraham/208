The resulting mean and standard deviation are <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$130\\text{ grams}$</span> and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5\\text{ grams}$</span>, respectively.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">The teacher later realizes that the scale used by students to measure the notebooks was not calibrated properly. The masses of the notebooks registered as <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2\\text{ grams}$</span> more than they should have been.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Without remeasuring all the notebooks, what values should the teacher use for the mean and standard deviation of these values?</div>",
