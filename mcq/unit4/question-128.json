  "question_text": "A science teacher has students measure the mass of their personal science notebooks using the same scale. The resulting mean and standard deviation are $130\\text{ grams}$ and $5\\text{ grams}$ , respectively. The teacher later realizes that the scale used by students to measure the notebooks was not calibrated properly. The masses of the notebooks registered as $2\\text{ grams}$ more than they should have been. Without remeasuring all the notebooks, what values should the teacher use for the mean and standard deviation of these values?",
