  "solution": "Solution\n\nFlipping a coin and recording the results is a random process. Just because there may be an obvious pattern in the answer does not mean that it could not be a random result.\n\nTossing a coin $4$ times would frequently give the result $HHTT$, but this pattern is far less likely to occur in $40$ tosses. So, while it is true that this exact result would not occur often in $20$ tosses of a coin, it still could happen and indicate a random process. Therefore, Cory is correct.\n\nSo, Choice 'B', is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because, while Cory is correct, the reasoning is not. We would expect $10$ heads and $10$ tails more often that any other combination, but it certainly would not happen all of the time or designate a random process by itself.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because Jackie is wrong. It would be possible for everyone in the class to be unable to achieve this result. This does not indicate, however, that the results were made up, just that it is a rare occurrence.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because Jackie is wrong. Yes, it is true that the longer the pattern lasts, the less likely that it will occur, but, it still can. Therefore, it does not indicate that the result was made up.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because Jackie is wrong. Yes, it may be a rare result, but it can still happen as a result of a random process!",
