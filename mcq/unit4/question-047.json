  "solution": "To find the probability that neither of $2$ randomly selected employees was born in-state, multiply probabilities:\n\n$$\\dfrac{48}{90}\\cdot\\dfrac{47}{89}=0.2816$$\n\nThis calculation uses the general multiplication rule which says:\n\n$$p\\left( A\\cap B \\right) =p(A)\\cdot p(B|A)$$\n\nLet $A$ represent the event that the first randomly selected employee was not born in-state.\n\nLet $B$ represent the event that the second randomly selected employee was not born in-state.\n\nThen $p(B|A)$ represents the probability that the second randomly selected employee is not born in-state GIVEN that the first randomly selected employee was not born in-state.\n\nOf the company's $90\\text{ employees}$, $42$ were born in-state. Then, $90-42=48\\text{ employees}$ were not born in-state. Therefore:\n\n$$p(A)=\\dfrac{48}{90}$$\n\nTo find, $p(B|A)$, we assume as given that the first randomly selected employee was not born in-state and look for the conditional probability that the second randomly selected employee was not born in-state. Once we have selected the first employee, there are only $89\\text{ employees}$ left to select from. Of these $89\\text{ employees}$, $47$ were not born in state. Therefore:\n\n$$p(B|A)=\\dfrac{47}{89}$$\n\nNow we can fill in the general multiplication rule as follows:\n\n$$p\\left( A\\cap B \\right) =p(A)\\cdot p(B|A)=\\dfrac{48}{90}\\cdot\\dfrac{47}{89}=0.2816$$\n\nChoice 'C' provides the correct probability.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and represents the probability that both of two randomly selected employees would be born in-state.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This answer is arrived at through the following calculation:\n\n$$\\dfrac{48\\cdot 47}{90\\cdot 90}$$\n\nWhile the numerator of this fraction is correct, the denominator is not. There are $90$ possible choices for the first selection but only $89$ possible choices for the second selection.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and assumes the probability of \"not in-state\" was $\\dfrac{48}{90}$ on both selections.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This is the probability that one randomly selected employee would not be born in-state.",
