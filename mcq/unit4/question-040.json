  "solution": "Solution\n\nMutually exclusive means that the two choices have no outcomes in common. So, you would look at each answer choice and see if you can find the same outcome that fits both categories.\n\nBut this question asks you to find the answer that IS mutually exclusive. There can also be more than two categories. When choosing a number, then, from a random number table, a single one-digit number cannot be both a 6 and an 8. And since neither of these numbers is odd, there is no possible answer that fits all of the given categories.\n\nSo, Choice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because the student picked can be both a male and a senior (a senior male!), so that this probability is not mutually exclusive.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because the student picked can be taking both Statistics and Band, so that this probability is not mutually exclusive.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because when flipping 3 coins one outcome is, in fact, 2 heads and 1 tail, so that this probability is not mutually exclusive.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because 27\nitself is both a multiple of 3\nas well as an odd number, so that this probability is not mutually exclusive.",
