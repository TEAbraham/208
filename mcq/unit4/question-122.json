  "solution": "For the game to be fair, one should expect to have a value (mean) of zero. To correctly answer this question, first determine the probabilities of rolling a sum of 7\nand rolling doubles from a pair of dice.\n\nMake a chart of the 36\npossible outcomes from rolling two dice:\n\nYou see that there are 6 ways\nout of 36\nto get a sum of 7\n(probability is\n6\n36\n=\n1\n6\n), and there are 6 ways\nout of 36\nto get doubles (probability of\n6\n36\n=\n1\n6\n).\n\nThis leaves 24 rolls\nthat are neither a sum of 7\nnor doubles, with a probability of\n24\n36\n=\n2\n3\n.\n\nNow create the probability distribution. The random variable\nX\nis the amount of money you win, so its values are\n0\n,\n5\n, or\n10\n.\n\nThe probability of each value of the random variable was calculated above and is entered in the\nP\n(\nX\n)\nrow as the probability for each value of the random variable.\n\nThe expected value\nE\n(\nX\n)\nis another name for the mean\nμ\nof a probability distribution, and it is calculated by the following formula:\n\nμ\n=\nE\n(\nX\n)\n=\n summation of \nX\ni\n⋅\nP\ni\n\nFor this problem:\n\nE\n(\nX\n)\n=\n(\n0\n)\n(\n24\n36\n)\n+\n(\n5\n)\n(\n6\n36\n)\n+\n(\n10\n)\n(\n6\n36\n)\n\n=\n0\n+\n5\n6\n+\n10\n6\n\n=\n15\n6\n\n=\n2.5\n\nSince the random variable is expressed in dollars, the expected value will be expressed in dollars, as\n$\n2.50\n.\n\nThis means that in the long run, you can expect to win an average of\n$\n2.50\neach time you play.\n\nThus, to make the game fair (you neither win nor lose, in the long run) you should be charged\n$\n2.50\neach time you play the game.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
