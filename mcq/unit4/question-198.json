  "solution": "This is a geometric distribution as this problem meets the geometric requirements.\n\n1) Two outcomes per trials: Eat banana or not eat banana 2) Independent: States it in the stem of the question 3) Counting the number of trials up to and including when the 1st chimpanzee eats a banana 4) Probability of success is the same per trial which p =0.05\n\nThe mean for a geometric distribution (formula not given on AP exam) is μ=\n1\np\nprobability of success.\n\nThe principle behind this formula is since the probability of success is p\nper each trial say p=0.25=\n1\n4\nthen we would expect it to take average of 4\ntrial to get the first success.\n\nOur answer can be determined:\n\nμ=\n1\n0.05\n=20\n\n...which is Choice 'D'.",
