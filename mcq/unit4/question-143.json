  "question_text": "A small fry weighs $3$ ounces with a standard deviation of $0.2$ ounces and a cheeseburger weighs $5$ ounces with a standard deviation of $0.4$ ounces. Jimmy makes a heart attack bet with one of his friends that he can eat $4$ small fries and $4$ cheeseburgers in 10 minutes.<br>Not only do we want to know if Jimmy can accomplish this heart attack goal, but what is the total mean and standard deviation in ounces for the $4$ cheeseburgers and $4$ small fries that Jimmy is about to devour?",

    }

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The easier part to find is the total mean. This can be found by adding the total ounces of the 4 cheeseburgers and 4 small fries:\n\n$${ \\mu }_{ 4F+4C }=3+3+3+3+5+5+5+5=4(3)+4(5)=32 \\ \\text{ ounces}$$\n\nChoices 'A' and 'B' can be eliminated. Note that $8$ represents the number of cheeseburgers and fries, but does not take into account their masses.\n\nTo find the total standard deviation, we must first find the variance. The variance is the standard deviation squared (${ \\sigma }^{ 2 }$).\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ 4F+4C }^{ 2 }={ (0.2) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.2) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.2) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.2) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.4) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.4) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.4) }^{ 2 }+{ (0.4) }^{ 2 }=0.80 \\ { \\text{ounces} }^{ 2 }$$\n\nTo find the standard deviation we must square root the variance:\n\n$$\\sqrt { { \\sigma }^{ 2 } } =\\sigma =\\sqrt { 0.80 \\ { \\text{ounces} }^{ 2 } } = 0.8944 \\ \\text{ounces}$$\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as the combined variance was never found. The standard deviations were just added together.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect as the square root of the variance was never taken.",
