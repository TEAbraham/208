  "solution": "Since it is stated the events are independent then the\n$$P(A\\text{ and } B)=P(A)\\cdot P(B)$$\n\n$$P(A)\\cdot P(B)=0.3\\cdot 0.1=0.03$$\n\nHowever Choice 'A' is incorrect because this only takes into consideration if they receive action figure A first and action figure B second. We need to also take into consideration if they receive action figure B first and action figure A second.\n\nWhat we need to find then is the P(A and then B) or P(B and then A).\nSince the events are disjoint the word or indicates we will sum up all the probabilities.\n\nP(A and then B) or P(B and then A) = P(A)⋅P(B)+P(B)⋅P(A)\n\nSubstituting the values in:\n\n0.3⋅0.1+0.1⋅0.3=0.06\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as this represents the case of P((A or B) and (B or A)).\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect as this represents the case of P(A or B).\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect as this represents the case of P((A or B) or (B or A)).",
