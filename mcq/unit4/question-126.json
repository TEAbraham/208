  "title": "Expected Earnings From Mowing Lawns for Extra Cash",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "Throughout high school, Jerry has been mowing lawns over the summer to earn extra cash. He has a few regular customers whose lawn he mows every week and others that he mows lawn for less frequently. He has kept very good records and knows that the number of lawns he mows each week is always between $5$ and $8$. The distribution is shown below.<br>Now that Jerry is getting ready for college, his younger brother Ben (who is just entering high school) wants to take over the lawn mowing business.<br>On average, how much money can Ben expect to make per week if he charges $\\$25$ per lawn and is able to keep the same customers his brother had throughout high school?",

  "solution": "The number of lawns that Ben will mow in a week is a random variable that we will call $x$. We will use the probability distribution given to find the mean or expected value of $x$.\n\nThe formula is:\n\nμx=∑(xi)(pi)=(x1)(p1)+(x2)(p2)+......+(xn)(pn)\n\nFill in the formula:\n\nμX=(5)(0.41)+(6)(0.35)+(7)(0.21)+(8)(0.03)=5.86\n\nNow we can find the average expected earnings by multiplying the μx\nby $25\n:\n\nμkX=k⋅μx\n\nμkX=(5.86)($25)=$146.50\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. The mean is 5.86\n, but this is not a dollar amount. It is the expected number of lawns mowed per week.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. It assumes that an average of 5\nlawns will be mowed each week.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. It assumes that an average of 6\nlawns will be mowed each week. While it is true that the number of lawns mowed in a given week can only be a whole number, we are looking for the average. An average need not be a whole number.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This answer assumes that the average number of lawns mowed per week can be found be taking the average of the possible values of x\nand arriving at a mean of 6.5\n.",
