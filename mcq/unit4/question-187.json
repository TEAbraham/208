  "title": "Coke vs Pepsi",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "Years ago, Pepsi wanted to show it was more popular than Coke.\nSo, Pepsi went around the country to various shopping centers giving people both colas to taste and tried to see if they knew the difference. Assuming that people do not know the difference (so $p=0.5$) if $64$ people came by to take the test, and $40$ seemed to know the difference, does this show it is likely true that people could tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi? Say \"yes\" or \"no\" and explain why using appropriate calculations.",

      "text": "No. With a mean of $32$ and a standard deviation of 4, we would expect to find $28$ to $36$ people on average to taste the difference. $40$ just is not that much higher and is not unusual so the people probably could not taste the difference."

      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Yes. With both the mean and the standard deviation equal to $16$, we would expect to find up to $32$ people on average who could taste the difference. Since $40$ is higher than $32$, then it is likely that they can taste the difference."

      "text": "Yes. With a mean of $16$ and a standard deviation of $4$, we would expect to find up to $20$ people on average who could taste the difference. $40$ is well above this so it is likely they can taste the difference."
