Assuming that people do not know the difference (so <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p=0.5$</span>) if <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$64$</span> people came by to take the test, and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> seemed to know the difference, does this show it is likely true that people could tell the difference between Coke and Pepsi?  Say \"yes\" or \"no\" and explain why using appropriate calculations.</div>",
