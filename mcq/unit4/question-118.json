  "solution": "The mean of a probability distribution is found by using the following formula:\n\nμ=the summation of each xi⋅pi term\n\nμ=(1)(0.42)+(2)(0.27)+(3)(0.3)+(4)(0.01)=1.9\n\nThis means that in the long run, the average number of days that it takes a first-class letter to reach its destination is 1.9 days. Notice that this is not one of the actual values of the random variable, but it still is the value of the mean, or expected value. Do NOT round expected value.\n\nThe standard deviation is a bit more difficult to calculate. Use the formula first for the variance of a random variable:\n\nVariance=the summation of (xi−μ)2⋅pi\n\nσ2=(1−1.9)2⋅0.42+(2−1.9)2⋅0.27+(3−1.9)2⋅0.3+(4−1.9)2⋅0.01\n\nσ2=0.75\n\nThe standard deviation is the square root of the variance, so the standard deviation for this probability distribution is\n√\n0.75\n days=0.87 days\n.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
