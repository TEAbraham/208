  "question_text": "While it is fairly common for people to be able to roll their tongue upwards ( $70\\%$ !), Caleb read once in a genetics book that only $1$ in $1000$ people can roll their tongue downwards.  For a  statistics project, Caleb decided to randomly sample $400$ of his fellow students and found $2$ of them who could do it.  What is Caleb's most accurate conclusion?",

      "text": "Finding 2 2 out of 400 400 is a rate of 0.005 0.005 which is much higher than the expected 0.001.  Therefore Caleb can conclude that the genetics book must be wrong and that the rate of those able to roll their tongue downwards is actually 0.005 0.005 ."

      "letter": "E",
      "text": "Though finding 2 2 out of 400 400 was a higher percentage than expected, Caleb can still maintain that the original claim is true and I believe that this is simply a result of random variation."
