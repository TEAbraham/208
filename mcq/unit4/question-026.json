  "solution": "To find the probability, we would use the following formula:\n\n$$p(\\text{Love It})=\\dfrac{\\text{total number who said \"Love It\"}}{\\text{total number surveyed}}$$\n\nFilling in the formula, we get:\n\n$$p(\\text{Love It})=\\dfrac{31+39}{100+100}=0.35$$\n\nChoice 'C' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This value probably represents a pure guess or is based on the (incorrect) assumption that each response was equally likely.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect and represents the probability that a man who was surveyed said \"Love It\".\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and represents the probability that a woman who was surveyed said \"Love It\".\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Although a total of $70$ individuals said \"Love It\", the total number of individuals surveyed was $200$. Therefore, $70\\%$ does not represent the percent of those sampled who said \"Love It\".",
