  "solution": "We know that the result was a number greater than $4$. This is a given condition. Therefore, we are looking for the probability of rolling a $6$ given that we rolled a number greater than $4$. We can use the formula for conditional probability.\n\n$$p(6|\\text{number}>4)=\\frac { p(6\\text{ is rolled}) }{ p(\\text{number}>4) } $$\n\nKeep in mind that the only values greater than $4$ are rolling a $5$ or a $6$:\n\n$$=\\frac { 0.14 }{ (0.25+0.14) } $$\n\n$$= 0.36$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. It represents the probability of obtaining a $6$ while having no known information about the result. You might also arrive at this answer by trying to use the multiplication property to find $p(6 \\text{ AND number}>4)$.\n\nIf a $6$ is obtained, it is obviously a number$>4$. Furthermore, we must obtain a $6$ and a number$>4$ on ONE roll of the dice. These are not independent or even separate events. Therefore, finding $p(6 \\text{ AND number}>4)$ by multiplying $(0.25)(0.14)$ is incorrect.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. It represents $p(6|\\text{number}\\ge4)$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. It represents $p(\\text{number}>4)$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It represents $p(\\text{number}\\ge4)$.",
