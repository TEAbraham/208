  "question_text": "A farmer’s harvest of apples has a normal distribution with the distribution of individual apple weights $µ = 5\\text{ ounces}$ , and $σ = 0.5\\text{ ounces}$ . Two apples are randomly chosen from this year’s harvest. The difference in the weights of the two apples is a normally distributed random variable. What are the mean and standard deviation of this distribution of differences?",
