  "solution": "The probability of getting a job from both companies = 0.30\nas stated in the problem.\n\nThe probability of getting a job from ONLY company A is: Probability of A – Probability of both A and B:\n\n=0.6−0.3=0.3\n\nThe probability of getting a job from ONLY company B is: Probability of B – Probability of both A and B:\n\n=0.5−0.3=0.2\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting neither job = 1\n– {Probability of only A + Probability of only B + Probability of both A and B}:\n\n=1–(0.3+0.2+0.3)=0.2\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
