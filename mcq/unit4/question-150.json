Juice bottles have a mean weight of $16$ ounces with a standard deviation of $2$ ounces.<br>What are the mean and standard deviation of the snack packs?",

  "solution": "When two independent distributions are combined (added), the means are added.\n\nThe snack packâ€™s mean weight is $6+16 = 22$ ounces. When two independent distributions are combined (added), the variances are added, and then the square root of the sum is taken to yield the new standard deviation.\n\nThus, the snack pack has a variance of $(0.5)^2+(2)^2= 4.25$.\n\nThe standard deviation is $\\sqrt{4.25} = 2.06$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'",
