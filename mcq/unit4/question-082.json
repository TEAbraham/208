  "question_text": "A random survey was conducted at a large suburban high school to determine if a relationship exists between being involved in extracurricular activities and higher grades. Extracurricular activities involve music, athletics, both activities, or neither. Grades are based off of grade point average (GPA).\nThe data is presented in the two-way table below:\n-- Music Athletics Both Neither Total\nGPA $<2.0$ $8$ $11$ $4$ $14$ $37$\n$2.0\\le$ GPA $\\le 3.0$ $19$ $19$ $25$ $16$ $79$\nGPA $\\ge 3.0$ $20$ $7$ $15$ $17$ $59$\nTotal $47$ $37$ $44$ $47$ $175$\n\n\nBased on the information in the table, which of the following statements is/are true?\nI. A two-way table does not make sense in this situation because GPA is quantitative.\nII. The Neither group has a relatively even distribution of GPAs.\nIII. Most students surveyed at this school have a GPA under $2.0$.",
