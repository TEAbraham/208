  "question_text": "A random survey was conducted at a large suburban high school to determine if a relationship exists between being involved in extracurricular activities and higher grades. Extracurricular activities involve music, athletics, both activities, or neither. Grades are based off of grade point average (GPA).<br>The data is presented in the two-way table below:<br>Based on the information in the table, which of the following statements is/are true?<br>I. A two-way table does not make sense in this situation because GPA is quantitative.<br>II. The Neither group has a relatively even distribution of GPAs.<br>III. Most students surveyed at this school have a GPA under $2.0$.",

Since this survey was fairly large and random, one cannot say that the majority of students at this school have a GPA less than $2.0$ since the sample proportion is so low at $21\\%$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
