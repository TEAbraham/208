The data is presented in the two-way table below: -- Music Athletics Both Neither Total GPA $<2.0$ $8$ $11$ $4$ $14$ $37$ $2.0\\le$ GPA $\\le 3.0$ $19$ $19$ $25$ $16$ $79$ GPA $\\ge 3.0$ $20$ $7$ $15$ $17$ $59$ Total $47$ $37$ $44$ $47$ $175$ Based on the information in the table, which of the following statements is/are true?
