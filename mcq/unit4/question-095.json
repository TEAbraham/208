  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Choice 'B' is a false statement and confuses the addition rule with the multiplication rule.\n\nThe addition rule states:\n\n$$p(A \\text{ or } B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A \\text{ and } B)$$\n\nWe cannot simply interchange the words “and” and “or” while also interchanging arithmetic operations. It is not true that:\n\n$$p(A \\text{ and } B) = p(A)\\cdot p(B)-p(A \\text{ or } B) $$\n\nChoices 'A' and 'D' are equivalent answers expressed in different ways. Choice 'A' uses words while Choice 'D' uses notation.\n\nBoth are true statements for independent events $A$ and $B$. Choice 'C' is also a true statement and simply reverses events $A$ and $B$.\n\nChoice 'E' is a true statement for independent events $A$ and $B$.",
