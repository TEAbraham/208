A deck has $52$ cards, $2$ colors (red and black), $4$ suits (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds), and $13$ different numbered cards including an ace, king, queen, and jack.  Four of the following probability problems are done incorrectly.  Which answer choice below is the one option that is done correctly?",
