A deck has $52$ cards, $2$ colors (red and black), $4$ suits (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds), and $13$ different numbered cards including an ace, king, queen, and jack. Four of the following probability problems are done incorrectly.\nWhich answer choice below is the one option that is done correctly?<br>Which answer choice below is the one option that is done correctly?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThis problem can only be done with the adding of the two fractions if the items in the question are mutually exclusive. This means that the chance that they both occur is zero.\n\nMutually exclusive events can have their probabilities added. Since an ace and a king cannot be picked at the same time, they are mutually exclusive. Therefore, their probabilities can be added. Using a deck of cards with $52$ cards in it means that all of the denominators are $52$. (While fractions can be simplified, it is not done here.)\n\nSince there are 13 different numbered cards, dividing 13 into 52 means that there are 4 of each numbered or type of card. Therefore, there are 4 aces and 4 kings, so that the chances of picking either one is:\n\n4\n52\n+\n4\n52\n=\n8\n52\n\nSo, Choice 'C' is the correct choice.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because an ace can also be a red card. This means that both events can occur, so that the events are not mutually exclusive and the probabilities cannot simply be added.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because, while this probability could be found, the wrong denominator is being used.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because a spade is a black card. This means that both events can occur, so that the events are not mutually exclusive and the probabilities cannot simply be added.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because an ace can also be a heart. This means that both events can occur, so that the events are not mutually exclusive and the probabilities cannot simply be added.",
