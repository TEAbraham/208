  "solution": "One has to assume cars driving down the street are a random sample of cars from the town; there is no reason to doubt this assumption based on the information in the problem.\n\nThe probability of a red car on the third trial can be found by finding the probability of a non-red, non-red, and then a red car:\n\n$$0.7\\cdot 0.7\\cdot 0.3 = 0.147$$\n\nThese probabilities can be multiplied since car colors are independent.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
