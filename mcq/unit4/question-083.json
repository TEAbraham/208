  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "In order to obtain $\\$25$ while only picking two bills, Dave must pull out one $\\$20$ bill and one $\\$5$ bill. He can do this by selecting the $\\$20$ first followed by the $\\$5$, or by selecting the $\\$5$ first followed by the $\\$20$.\n\nFind the probability as follows:\n\n$$p(\\$20,\\$5)+p(\\$5,\\$20)=\\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ 10 } \\right) \\left( \\dfrac { 3 }{ 9 } \\right) +\\left( \\dfrac { 3 }{ 10 } \\right) \\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ 9 } \\right) =\\dfrac { 1 }{ 15 }$$\n\nYou may also find the probability using the basic definition of probability and combinations. That is:\n\n$$\\dfrac { \\left( { { 1 } } \\right) \\cdot \\left( { 3 } \\right) }{ { _{ 10 }{ C }_{ 2 } } }$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because it assumes that after the first bill is selected, it is replaced prior to the selection of the second bill. It has been calculated as:\n\n$$\\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ 10 } \\right) \\left( \\dfrac { 3 }{ 10 } \\right)$$\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because it only includes one order in which the bills may be selected. It represents the probability of picking the $\\$20$ first followed by picking the $\\$5$. Alternatively, it could represent the probability of picking the $\\$5$ first followed by the $\\$20$. It does not however, include both orders in which $\\$25$ could successfully be obtained.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. It simply represents the probability of picking one of the $\\$5$ bills on the selection of a single bill.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It recognizes the fact that there are $4$ out the $10$ bills that are important to the situation, but then assumes $\\dfrac{4}{10}$ to be the related probability.",
