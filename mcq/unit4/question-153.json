  "question_text": "Nuts and Berries is an online company that sells different types of nut butters (like peanut butter and almond butter) and different types of jams (like raspberry jam and grape jam). Jams are sold in $8\\text{ oz}$ quantities and nut butters are sold in $12\\text{ oz}$ quantities.<br>If the mean weight of one jar of grape jam is $8.6\\text{ oz}$ with a standard deviation of $0.17\\text{ oz}$, and the average weight of a jar of peanut butter is $12.7\\text{ oz}$ with a standard deviation of $0.23\\text{ oz}$, what is the standard deviation of the weight of an order consisting of $3\\text{ jars}$ of grape jam and $1\\text{ jar}$ of peanut butter? Assume that the weights of all $4$ jars in this order are independent.",

  "solution": "The weight of one jar of grape jam is a random variable that we will call $J$. The weight of one jar of peanut butter is a random variable that we will call $N$. We are looking for the standard deviation of the quantity $J + J +J + N$.\n\nWe know that these variables are all independent. Keep in mind that the standard deviations of independent random variables do not add. However, variances do!\n\nStart by finding the variance of J and N.\n\nSince ${\\sigma}_J = 0.17$, we know ${\\sigma}^2_J= (0.17)^2 = 0.0289$\nSince ${\\sigma}_N = 0.23$, we know ${\\sigma}^2_{N}=(0.23)^2 = 0.0529$\n\nTo find the standard deviation of $J + J + J + N$, we would take the square root of the sum of the individual variances.\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ J+J+J+N }$$\n\n$$=\\sqrt { { { \\sigma }_{ J }^{ 2 }+{ \\sigma }_{ J }^{ 2 }+{ \\sigma }_{ J }^{ 2 }+{ \\sigma }_{ N }^{ 2 } } } $$\n\n$$=\\sqrt { 0.0289+0.0289+ 0.0289 +0.0529 } $$\n\n$$=\\sqrt { 0.1396 } $$\n\n$$=0.374$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because it attempts to find the combined variance by using transformations of random variables rather than combinations of random variables. Although $J + J + J + N$ algebraically is equivalent to $3J + N$, the following calculations do not accurately find the variance of $J + J + J + N$.\n\n$${\\sigma}_{3J} = 3{\\sigma}_J=(3)(0.17) = 0.51 $$\n\n$${\\sigma}^2_{3J}=(0.51)^2 = 0.2601$$\n\n$${\\sigma}^2_{N}=(0.23)^2 = 0.0529$$\n\n$${\\sigma}^2_{3J+N} = {\\sigma}^2_{3J}+{\\sigma}^2_N=0.2601+0.0529 = 0.313$$\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ 3J+N }=\\sqrt { 0.313 } $$\n\n$$\\bf =0.559$$\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. We cannot assume that since there are more jars of jam in the order, that the standard deviation of the entire order is equal to the standard deviation of a jar of jam. Also, we should not simply choose the smaller of the two given standard deviations.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. We cannot assume that since the standard deviation of a jar of nut butter is greater than the standard deviation of a jar of jam, that we should simply choose the larger of the two standard deviations.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. We cannot simply add the standard deviations of the individual components of the order. The following calculation is incorrect: $0.17 + 0.17 + 0.17 + 0.23 = 0.74$.",
