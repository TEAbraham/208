  "solution": "Since one ticket can only be for one seat in one section, we know that the different types of tickets are mutually exclusive. The relative frequencies must add up to $100\\%$.\n\nDo not make the mistake of thinking that because the relative frequency for bleacher seats was left empty that the relative frequency must be zero. Start by finding the relative frequency for bleacher seats:\n\n$$100\\% - 38\\% - 20\\% - 14\\% - 6\\% = 22\\%$$\n\nTo find the probability that the randomly selected winner will be from a field box seat or a bleacher seat, simply add the individual probabilities:\n\n$$p(\\text{field box or bleacher}) = 38\\% + 22\\% = 60\\%$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. It represents the probability that the winner will come from the picnic area/standing section.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. It represents the probability that the winner will come from the bleachers.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. It represents the probability that the winner will have a field box seat.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It represents the probability that the winner will have a seat of any type other than picnic area/standing.",
