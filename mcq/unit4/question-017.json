  "question_text": "A $6$-sided die was rolled $100$ times with answers recorded in order. These answers were examined $2$ at a time, and each time a pair contained the same number, this was noted. The number of pairs with the same set of numbers was then divided by $50$ and given as a probability estimate. This simulation describes which of the following situations?",

      "text": "For a statistics project, a student randomly selected $100$ students and asked their gender. Then the students' grade point averages were split evenly into $6$ groups. The student wanted to estimate the probability of finding two of the same gender in the same grade point average group."

      "text": "The SAT scores at a high school were split evenly into $6$ groups based on total scores. The students in each group were assigned a number from $1$ to $6$. For a statistics project a student wanted to estimate the probability of one student being in the same group as another student."

For a statistics project a student wanted to estimate the probability of how often a student's verbal score fell into the same category as the math score."
