  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "A quiz has $8$ multiple choice questions with five answers for each (A, B, C, D, and E).\nThe teacher decided to give two versions of the quiz with the same questions and same responses but switched the order of the answers to create two different keys with no answers in common.\nOne of the students ended up getting $7$ of the $8$ questions wrong, but the $7$ she got incorrect matched the other answer key perfectly.\nThe teacher decided to use binomial probabilities to find the probability of randomly guessing this close or closer to the other answer key.\nWhat did the teacher find out?",
