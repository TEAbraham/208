  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "A quiz has $8$ multiple choice questions with five answers for each (A, B, C, D, and E).<br>The teacher decided to give two versions of the quiz with the same questions and same responses but switched the order of the answers to create two different keys with no answers in common.<br>One of the students ended up getting $7$ of the $8$ questions wrong, but the $7$ she got incorrect matched the other answer key perfectly.<br>The teacher decided to use binomial probabilities to find the probability of randomly guessing this close or closer to the other answer key.<br>What did the teacher find out?",

  "solution": "It correctly uses binomial probabilities. Assuming the student is simply guessing:\n\n$$\\text{P(7 or 8 questions correct)} = \\text{P(7)+P(8)}$$\n\n$$0.2^7 \\times 0.8^1\\times { _{ 8 }{ C }_{ 1 } }+0.2^8= 0.00008448$$\n\nSince it would be incredibly unlikely for the student to randomly guess this close to the answer key (or closer), there is strong evidence to suggest that the student cheated.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; this situation follows the binomial situation since there are a fixed number of trials ($8$), success or failure (whether the question is correct or not), same probability ($20\\%$), and getting each question is independent.",
