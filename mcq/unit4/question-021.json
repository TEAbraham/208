  "question_text": "Last week, Abby completely forgot to study for her multiple choice test.<br>She decides to randomly guess on each question. Suppose the test has four answer possibilities for each question (A, B, C, and D).<br>How could one use simulation to determine the number of questions she could answer correctly until she gets one wrong?",
