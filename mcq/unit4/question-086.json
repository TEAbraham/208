  "question_text": "A random survey was conducted at a large suburban high school to determine if a relationship exists between being involved in extracurricular activities and higher grades. Extracurricular activities involve music, athletics, both activities, or neither. Grades are based on grade point average (GPA).<br>The data is presented in the two-way table below:<br>Which would be the best probability calculation to show that being involved in extra-curricular activities is related to higher Grade Point Average?<br>Which would be the best probability calculation to show that being involved in extra-curricular activities is related to higher Grade Point Average?",

  "solution": "This calculation clearly compares GPAs of students in both music and athletics with those who are involved in neither.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; while this is a true statement, this calculation considers only music students (and not students in athletics), nor does it consider students in neither music nor athletics.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; while this is also a true statement, this calculation considers only students in athletics and does not compare it to students in the Neither category.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; this statement does not give a probability calculation and does not compare to students in music, athletics, or both.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. The statement does show that students involved in both music and athletics typically do fairly well. However, it does not compare this to how well students involved in neither music nor athletics perform.",
