  "question_text": "A random survey was conducted at a large suburban high school to determine if a relationship exists between being involved in extracurricular activities and higher grades. Extracurricular activities involve music, athletics, both activities, or neither. Grades are based on grade point average (GPA).\nThe data is presented in the two-way table below:\n-- Music Athletics Both Neither Total\nGPA $<2.0$ $8$ $11$ $4$ $14$ $37$\n$2.0\\le$ GPA $\\le 3.0$ $19$ $19$ $25$ $16$ $79$\nGPA $\\ge 3.0$ $20$ $7$ $15$ $17$ $59$\nTotal $47$ $37$ $44$ $47$ $175$\n\n\nWhich would be the best probability calculation to show that being involved in extra-curricular activities is related to higher Grade Point Average?",
