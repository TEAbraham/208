  "question_text": "From a large population, you take a random sample of size $n = 30$ and obtain a sample mean $\\bar{x} = 21.34$ and $s = 3.2$ . You add additional members of the population to this sample. What does the “law of large numbers” tell us about the mean and standard deviation of this ever-increasing sample?",
