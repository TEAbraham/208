  "solution": "To find the mean total amount of time (in seconds) it takes for all four girls to complete the medley, we simply need to add the individual means:\n\n$$26.74+30.17+25.36+24.97 = 107.24$$\n\nMore formally, the amount of time it takes each girl to swim $200$ meters using her assigned swimming stroke is a random variable. We are given the mean for each random variable.\n\n${ \\mu }_{ A } = 26.74$ where ${ \\mu }_{ A }$ represents Abby's mean time.\n${ \\mu }_{ B } = 30.17$ where ${ \\mu }_{ B }$ represents Bella's mean time.\n${ \\mu }_{ C } = 25.36$ where ${ \\mu }_{ C}$ represents Claudia's mean time.\n${ \\mu }_{ D } = 24.97$ where ${ \\mu }_{ D }$ represents Danielle's mean time.\n\nThen:\n\n$${ \\mu }_{ A+B+C+D } ={ \\mu }_{ A }+{ \\mu }_{ B }+{ \\mu }_{ C }+{ \\mu }_{ D }=26.74+30.17+25.36+24.97=107.24$$\n\nWe know there are $60$ seconds in $1$ minute. To find out how many additional seconds there are in this time, we simply subtract.\n$$107.24-60=47.24$$\n\nTherefore, the total mean time is $1$ minute, $47.24$ seconds.\n\nChoice 'D' is the correct answer as it is the choice that is closest to the actual mean.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This is the sum of the individual standard deviations. It is not however, the standard deviation of the total amount of time needed for the four girls to complete the relay.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This is the average of the mean times for all four girls.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Since there are $60$ seconds in one minute, $0.75$ minutes would be $(0.75)(60)$ or $45$ seconds and $1.75$ minutes would be $1$ minute, $45$ seconds. This is close to the correct answer, but not it is not the closest choice!\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This answer is not reasonable. By estimating we can determine that since each girl's average time is well under $1$ minute, the total average time to complete the relay would be well under $4$ minutes and certainly would not be more than an hour!",
