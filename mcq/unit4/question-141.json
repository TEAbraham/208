Suppose each citation has an average fine of $\\$115.32$.<br>What are the mean and standard deviation of the revenue the police department takes in per month from minor citations?",

  "solution": "In this situation, the mean and standard deviation should both be transformed by multiplying each term by $\\$115.32$.\n\nWhen multiplying data by any constant, both the mean and standard deviation is multiplied by this constant.\n\n$\\text{Mean} = 84.3 \\times \\$115.32 = \\$9{,}721.48$\n\n$\\text{Standard deviation} = 12.6 \\times \\$115.32 = \\$1{,}453.03$\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
