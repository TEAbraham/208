  "solution": "We do not know if the scores are normally distributed; therefore, we must use Chebyshev’s rule. Since $68-k(4) = 60$, then $k = 2$.\n\nAs such, at most\n1\n4\n=25% of the scores are less than 60. We know that 850 students took the test, so there are at most (0.25)(850)=212.5 or 213 scores less than 60. This is the best approximation we can make since we do not know if the distribution is normally distributed.\n\nIt may be that far fewer than 213 students fall below a 60, but we cannot make that statement without the assumption of a normal distribution. Chebyshev’s rule must be used in this instance.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'",
