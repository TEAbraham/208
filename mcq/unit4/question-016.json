While the percentages change slightly from year to year, he found that in <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2020$</span> that approximately <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$63\\%$</span> of hits were singles, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$18\\%$</span> were doubles, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$15\\%$</span> were home runs, and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4\\%$</span> were triples.  Danny wanted to simulate <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$200$</span> at bats using these percentages.  How would he assign numbers using a random number table?  Then, how would he calculate the estimated probabilities from using his table?</div>",
