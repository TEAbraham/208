  "question_text": "Danny wanted to do a simulation on the types of hits in baseball. While the percentages change slightly from year to year, he found that in $2020$ that approximately $63\\%$ of hits were singles, $18\\%$ were doubles, $15\\%$ were home runs, and $4\\%$ were triples. Danny wanted to simulate $200$ at bats using these percentages. How would he assign numbers using a random number table? Then, how would he calculate the estimated probabilities from using his table?",
