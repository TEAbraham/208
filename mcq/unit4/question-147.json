  "solution": "The amount of time it takes each girl to swim $200$ meters using her assigned swimming stroke is a random variable. We are given the mean and standard deviation for each random variable and are interested in the standard deviation.\n\n${ \\sigma }_{ A } = 1.32$ where ${ \\sigma }_{ A }$ represents the standard deviation of Abby's swim times.\n${ \\sigma }_{ B } = 1.57$ where ${ \\sigma }_{ B }$ represents the standard deviation of Bella's swim times.\n${ \\sigma }_{ C } = 1.12$ where ${ \\sigma }_{ C}$ represents the standard deviation of Claudia's swim times.\n${ \\sigma }_{ D } = 1.15$ where ${ \\sigma }_{ D }$ represents the standard deviation of Danielle's swim times.\n\nSince each girl's time is independent of the others, we can find the variance of the amount of time it takes for all four girls to complete the relay by adding the individual variances. We must find the individual variances first, because we know that variances for independent random variables can be added while standard deviations cannot.\n\n${ \\sigma }_{ A }^{ 2 }={ \\left( 1.32 \\right) }^{ 2 }=\\quad 1.74$\n${ \\sigma }_{ B }^{ 2 }={ \\left( 1.57\\right) }^{ 2 }=\\quad 2.46$\n${ \\sigma }_{ C }^{ 2 }={ \\left( 1.12 \\right) }^{ 2 }=\\quad 1.25$\n${ \\sigma }_{ D }^{ 2 }={ \\left( 1.15 \\right) }^{ 2 }=\\quad 1.32$\n\nThen:\n\n$${ \\sigma }_{ A+B+C+D }^{ 2 }=1.74+2.46+1.25+1.32 = 6.77$$\n\n.... which means that the variance of the total amount of time it takes for all four girls to complete the relay is $6.77$ seconds.\n\nTo find the standard deviation, simply take the square root of the variance:\n\n$$\\sqrt { 6.77 } =2.60$$\n\nChoice 'C' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and represents the average of the four given standard deviations.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect and is the square root of the correct answer.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and is the sum of the four given standard deviations. While we can add variances to find the variance of the sum of independent random variables, we can never find the standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables by adding the individual standard deviations.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and is the variance of the total amount of time needed to complete the relay.",
