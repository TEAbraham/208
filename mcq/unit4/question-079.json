  "solution": "The easiest way to visualize this problem is with a tree diagram.\n\nThe probability of each of the four possible paths is obtained by multiplying the two probabilities along each path.\n\nEither of two paths results in a win:\n\nPlay at home and win, with $P = 0.6 \\cdot 0.7 = 0.42$\n\nPlay away and win, with P=0.4â‹…0.35=0.14\n\nAdd these disjoint probabilities together to result in the overall probability of winning a game:\n\n(0.42+0.14)=0.56\n\nTherefore, the basketball team has a 56% chance, or 0.56 probability, of winning the game, so Choice 'D' is correct.",
