  "difficulty": "Moderate",
  "question_text": "According to U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, between September 2014 and September 2015, about $25\\%$ of the population (age $16$ and older) volunteered with or through an organization at least once.  Suppose this value has not changed. In random samples of adults of size $n=50$ , what is the mean and standard deviation of the number of individuals who would say they have volunteered with or through an organization at least once?",
