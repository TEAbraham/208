  "question_text": "Workers at a large company inspect large wooden bookcases for defects and then wrap the bookcases to be ready to ship.\nThe average worker takes $21\\text{ seconds}$ to inspect a bookcase with a standard deviation of $3\\text{ seconds}$. The average worker takes $41\\text{ seconds}$ to wrap a bookcase with a standard deviation of $18\\text{ seconds}$. The assembly line starts to get backed up if the entire process takes longer than $1\\text{ minute}$ and $15\\text{ seconds}$.\nAssuming the times for each process are independent and approximately normal, what is the probability of a bookcase taking more than $1\\text{ minute}$ and $15\\text{ seconds}$ for the entire inspection and wrapping process?",
