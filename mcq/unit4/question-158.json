  "question_text": "Workers at a large company inspect large wooden bookcases for defects and then wrap the bookcases to be ready to ship.<br>The average worker takes $21\\text{ seconds}$ to inspect a bookcase with a standard deviation of $3\\text{ seconds}$. The average worker takes $41\\text{ seconds}$ to wrap a bookcase with a standard deviation of $18\\text{ seconds}$. The assembly line starts to get backed up if the entire process takes longer than $1\\text{ minute}$ and $15\\text{ seconds}$.<br>Assuming the times for each process are independent and approximately normal, what is the probability of a bookcase taking more than $1\\text{ minute}$ and $15\\text{ seconds}$ for the entire inspection and wrapping process?",

  "solution": "To find the mean for the total process, we can add the means: 21+41=62 seconds.\n\nStandard deviations cannot be added, but variances can in order to then find the standard deviation:\n\nVariance of the entire process:\n\n32+182=333\n\nRemember that variance is calculated by squaring standard deviation.\n\nThe standard deviation of the entire process, therefore, is\n√\n333\n=18.25\n.\n\nThe next process is to standardize the value of 1 minute\nand 15 seconds\n(or a total of 75 seconds\n):\n\nz=\n(75−62)\n(18.25)\n=0.71\n\nUsing the standard normal table, we find that at a z\n-score of 0.71\nis at the 0.7611\npoint and we want to know the portion of the distribution above that point:\n\nP(z>0.71)=1−0.7611=0.2389\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
