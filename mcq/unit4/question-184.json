  "solution": "Even though a value of 2\nwas rolled 17 times\nbefore, each roll is independent, which means that each roll carries the same probable outcome of a 2\nas every roll before it and every roll after.\n\nThe expected value can be calculated:\n\nExpected=np\n\n=72â‹…(\n1\n6\n)\n\n=12\n\n...which is consistent with Choice 'C'.",
