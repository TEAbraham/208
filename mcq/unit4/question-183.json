  "question_text": "Suppose a middle school gym currently has $50$ students inside: $28$ students are in $7$th grade, and $22$ students are in $8$th grade. The principal decides to randomly select $5$ of these students to represent the school at the school board meeting.<br>Four of the $5$ students randomly chosen happened to be in the $8$th grade. The principalâ€™s secretary, surprised by this result, uses binomial calculations to find the likelihood of $4$ or more of those $5$ selected students being in the $8$th grade.<br>Why would it be incorrect to use binomial calculations in this situation?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Choice 'A' is incorrect; while it is true that the probabilities are not 50/50\nin this problem, that is NOT an issue when calculating a binomial probability.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; there are a fixed number of trials; in this case, n=5\n.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct; the selections are not independent. For example, once a 7\nth grader is chosen from a pool of 50\nstudents, the probability of another 7\nth-grade student being chosen is slightly less, since the pool has shrunk.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; there are two outcomes in this situation; the student is either a 7\nth grader or an 8\nth grader.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; sample size is not an issue when dealing with binomial calculations.",
