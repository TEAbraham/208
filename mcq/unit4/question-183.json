  "question_text": "Suppose a middle school gym currently has $50$ students inside: $28$ students are in $7$ th grade, and $22$ students are in $8$ th grade. The principal decides to randomly select $5$ of these students to represent the school at the school board meeting. Four of the $5$ students randomly chosen happened to be in the $8$ th grade. The principal’s secretary, surprised by this result, uses binomial calculations to find the likelihood of $4$ or more of those $5$ selected students being in the $8$ th grade. Why would it be incorrect to use binomial calculations in this situation?​",
