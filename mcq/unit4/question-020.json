So, in a deck there are <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$16$</span> face cards. Suppose you want to know how often you might get a poker hand of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> cards with <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span> or <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> face cards in it.  How might you estimate this probability using simulation with a random number table?</div>",
