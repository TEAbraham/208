  "question_text": "In a full deck of $52$ cards, let's consider jacks, queens, kings, and aces to be face cards.  So, in a deck there are $16$ face cards. Suppose you want to know how often you might get a poker hand of $5$ cards with $4$ or $5$ face cards in it.  How might you estimate this probability using simulation with a random number table?",

For each group of 5 5 , count how many are face cards and keep track of how many hands have 4 4 or 5 5 face cards in them.  Divide this number by 80 to estimate the probability."
