  "solution": "Two events are disjoint if they cannot happen at the same time, and two events are independent if knowing of one event does not change the probability of the other event occurring.\n\nComplementary events are NEVER independent; knowing one of the events occurs drops the probability of the other event to 0.\n\nComplementary events are ALWAYS disjoint. For example, a single roll of a normal six-sided die could not yield “get a 3\n” and “not get a 3\n” at the same time.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
