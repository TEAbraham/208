  "solution": "Because this is an “or” question, you must use the addition rule for probability:\n\nP\n(\nA\n or \nB\n)\n=\nP\n(\nA\n)\n+\nP\n(\nB\n)\n−\nP\n(\nA\n and \nB\n)\n\nBecause\nA\nand\nB\nare independent, they can both happen at the same time, so their probabilities must be multiplied together. The formula becomes:\n\nP\n(\nA\n or \nB\n)\n=\n0.5\n+\n0.4\n−\n(\n0.5\n)\n(\n0.4\n)\n=\n0.5\n+\n0.4\n−\n0.2\n=\n0.7\n\n...which is Choice 'D'.",
