  "solution": "The distribution of a quantitative variable basically tells the reader what values the variable takes on and how often it takes on these values. Based off this definition, one should be able to determine shape, center, and spread from this distribution.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the wording in the question clearly shows a single variable.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; a boxplot can be a useful way to describe data, but the plot will not be able to say exactly what values the variable takes on and their frequency.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; distributions are often displayed with quantitative data.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; distributions of all different types of shapes can be shown.",
