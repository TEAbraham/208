  "question_text": "Allison just started studying for her AP Statistics exam. She is unfamiliar with the material so she simply has to guess at the multiple choice questions. She decided to answer multiple-choice questions with five selections (A, B, C, D, and E) until she got one incorrect.<br>Does this situation involve the geometric distribution?",

      "text": "No, a fixed number of trials does not exist in this situation"

    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "No, because there is not the same probability of answering one question versus the next correctly"

      "letter": "D",
      "text": "No, because success on each question is NOT independent of the next question"

    {
      "letter": "E",
      "text": "No, because there are more than two outcomes since five solutions exist to each question"
    }
  ],
  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "In this case, all four conditions are met for the geometric distribution:\n\n1. Is each trial independent?\n\nYes, getting one question correct has no bearing on getting the next question correct.\n\n2. Only two outcomes?\n\nYes, the student either gets the question correct or incorrect.\n\n3.\nSame Probability?\n\nYes, with five possibilities there is no question that is systematically harder to get correct than another.\n\n4.\nVariable of interest is the number of trials until success?\n\nYes, she is answering questions until she gets one wrong. “Success” does not necessarily have to be a positive outcome.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
