  "question_text": "Allison just started studying for her AP Statistics exam. She is unfamiliar with the material so she simply has to guess at the multiple choice questions. She decided to answer multiple-choice questions with five selections (A, B, C, D, and E) until she got one incorrect. Does this situation involve the geometric distribution?",

      "text": "No, a fixed number of trials does not exist in this situation"

    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "No, because there is not the same probability of answering one question versus the next correctly"

      "text": "No, because success on each question is NOT independent of the next question"
