  "question_text": "Allison just started studying for her AP Statistics exam. She is unfamiliar with the material so she simply has to guess at the multiple choice questions. She decided to answer multiple-choice questions with five selections (A, B, C, D, and E) until she got one incorrect.\nDoes this situation involve the geometric distribution?",
