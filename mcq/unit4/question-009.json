  "question_text": "During a professional football season, athletes are routinely and randomly screen for performance enhancing drugs (PEDs). Each week, five players from each team will be randomly selected using a chance process to be tested for PEDs. One football player is confused on why he has been \"randomly\" selected five weeks in a row.\nWhat is the player misinformed about?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Random variation is a topic that is often misunderstood. Many people believe that if an outcome occurs using a chance process, that the outcome can no longer happen, even if it has a probability of doing so. Using a completely random chance process implies that each individual has an equally likely chance of being selected every time the process is used.\n\nIn this case, the football players selected for testing as selected using a chance process. Therefore, every player has an equally likely chance of being selected each week. Therefore, even though the probability could be relatively small, the athlete that was selected five weeks in a row simply was due to randomness, not anything nefarious.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
