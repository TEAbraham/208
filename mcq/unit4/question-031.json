  "solution": "The formula for the mean of a geometric distribution is $\\left(\\dfrac{1}{P}\\right)$, where $P$ is the probability of interest.\n\nIn this situation, since the shooter continues until the shot is missed, the probability of missing the shot = $0.25$.\n\n$$\\left(\\dfrac{1}{0.25}\\right) = 4$$\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
