  "solution": "When drawing a histogram, the center is the point where approximately half of the area is to the left, and approximately half of the area is to the right. This corresponds to a value of near 3.5. The center can be a non-integer.\n\nThe shape, when graphed, will be approximately normal. No real-life data is perfectly normal, so the word “approximately” or some similar word must be used in front of it.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
