  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">The game of Craps is a casino game in which a player rolls a pair of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$6$</span>-sided dice. On the first roll of the dice, if the sum is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$7$</span> or <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$11$</span>, it is called a “natural” and the player wins. Sierra wants to try the game but wonders what the probability of a “natural” is.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Unfortunately, she is really bad at probability so she programs her computer to simulate <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10,000$</span> tosses of a pair of dice and use the results to calculate the probability of a “natural”.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of the following would Sierra most likely conclude as a result of this simulation? Why? </div>",
