  "solution": "When using a chance device to determine <strong>randomness</strong> it is important to realize that each roll is not affected by previous rolls. This means that one each roll, each side of the six-sided number cube is equally likely to occur. Additionally, just because there seems to be a pattern in my data does not imply that the outcomes were random. \n\nIn this case, just because the number cube repeats itself, or seems to follow a pattern, does not mean that the outcomes are less random then if they do not follow a pattern. Therefore, since all trials used the same number cube, all outcomes are equally random. \n\n<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is correct. ",

    "C": "<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is incorrect. Just because a trial follows a pattern does not imply the outcomes are not random. ",
    "D": "<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is incorrect. Even though the outcome seems more random than the others, this outcome is equally as random as the rest."
