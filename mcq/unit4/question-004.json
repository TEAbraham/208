He repeats this process for a total of four trials. Here are his results:\nTrial $1$: {$1$, $6$, $1$, $6$}\nTrial $2$: {$1$, $2$, $3$, $4$}\nTrial $3$: {$4$, $4$, $4$, $4$}\nTrial $4$: {$2$, $5$, $6$, $1$}\nWhich trial was the most random?",

  "solution": "When using a chance device to determine randomness it is important to realize that each roll is not affected by previous rolls. This means that one each roll, each side of the six-sided number cube is equally likely to occur. Additionally, just because there seems to be a pattern in my data does not imply that the outcomes were random.\n\nIn this case, just because the number cube repeats itself, or seems to follow a pattern, does not mean that the outcomes are less random then if they do not follow a pattern. Therefore, since all trials used the same number cube, all outcomes are equally random.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
