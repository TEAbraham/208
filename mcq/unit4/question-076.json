The teacher claims that selection of students is random.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">The class contains <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$18\\text{ students}$</span>: <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8$</span> wearing polos and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10$</span> wearing sweatshirts. Suppose all <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5\\text{ students}$</span> picked were wearing polos. One of the students feels this is enough evidence to say that the teacher unfairly calls on students wearing polos too often and the selection most likely is not random.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Do you think the selection is random?â€‹</div>",
