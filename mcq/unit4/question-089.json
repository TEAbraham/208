  "question_text": "In the game of Yahtzee, a player tosses $5$, fair, $6$-sided dice while trying to form various combinations like three of a kind (for example: $4, 4, 4, 5, 1$), or a full house (for example: $2, 2, 2, 6, 6$). If all five dice show the same number (for example: $3, 3, 3, 3, 3$), the player has rolled a Yahtzee.<br>How would you calculate the probability that a player will roll Yahtzee on their first roll of the dice?",

  "solution": "To roll a Yahtzee, a player could roll five $1$'s or five $2$'s or five $3$'s or five $4$'s or five $5$'s or five $6$'s.\n\n$p(\\text{five $1$'s})$ can be found using the multiplication rule. That is:\n\n$$p(1, 1, 1, 1, 1) = \\left( \\frac { 1 }{ 6 } \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac { 1 }{ 6 } \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\frac { 1 }{ 6 } \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ 6 } \\right) \\cdot \\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ 6 } \\right) ={ \\left( \\frac { 1 }{ 6 } \\right) }^{ 5 }$$\n\n$p(\\text{five $2$'s})$ is calculated exactly the same way and produces the same answer as $p(\\text{five $1$'s})$.\n\nIn fact:\n\n$$p(\\text{five $\n1$'s})=p(\\text{five $2$'s})=p(\\text{five $3$'s})=p(\\text{five $4$'s})=p(\\text{five $5$'s})=p(\\text{five $6$'s})$$\n\nTherefore:\n\n$$p(\\text{Yahtzee})={ \\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ 6 } \\right) }^{ 5 }\\cdot 6$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as it does not account for all five dice being rolled. It simply represents the probability of rolling a specific (unknown) number when a single dice is tossed.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because it does not account for the fact that a Yahtzee could be achieved by rolling any one of the six possible outcomes on every dice. This represents the probability of rolling $5$ dice which result in the same specific (unknown) number, such as rolling five $1$'s.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. We cannot simply multiply the probability of rolling a specific (unknown) number by $5$ to account for the fact that five dice are being tossed.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Although the actual probability is quite close to zero, there is still a very small probability that a player will toss a Yahtzee on their first roll of the dice.",
