  "question_text": "In the game of Yahtzee, a player tosses $5$ , fair, $6$ -sided dice while trying to form various combinations like three of a kind (for example: $4, 4, 4, 5, 1$ ), or a full house (for example: $2, 2, 2, 6, 6$ ). If all five dice show the same number (for example: $3, 3, 3, 3, 3$ ), the player has rolled a Yahtzee. How would you calculate the probability that a player will roll Yahtzee on their first roll of the dice?",
