During their grand opening celebration, everyone who stops by will be given one ticket which contains an area that can be scratched off to reveal a single prize.\nConsider a case where $50\\%$ of the tickets reveal a discount, $20\\%$ of the tickets reveal a free beverage, $15\\%$ of the tickets reveal a free appetizer, $10\\%$ of the tickets reveal a free dessert, and the remaining tickets reveal a free entree.\nWhat is the probability that the individual who receives the first ticket will win either a free appetizer or free entree (assume that this individual is able to pick one of the tickets at random)?",
