To gather data, they surveyed a random sample of men and women and asked them to identify whether they shop online \"Often\", \"Sometimes\", or \"Rarely\". The results of the survey are shown in the table below.<br>Which of the following graphs appropriately displays the conditional distribution of online shopping habits by gender?<br>Which of the following graphs appropriately displays the conditional distribution of online shopping habits by gender?",

  "solution": "When looking for the conditional distribution of a certain variable, the percentages associated with that variable must add to\n100\n%\n. Here, we are looking for the conditional distribution of online shopping habits.\n\nTherefore, the percentages associated with online shopping habits must add to\n100\n%\n. We want these distributions separated out by gender. Therefore, we need to find the percentage of each response for women and the percentage of each response for men.\n\nFor men:\n\nOften:\n29\n93\n=\n0.312\n≈\n31\n%\n\nSometimes:\n32\n93\n=\n0.344\n≈\n34\n%\n\nRarely:\n32\n93\n=\n0.344\n≈\n34\n%\n\nNote: these percentages do not add to exactly\n100\n%\n. However, this is simply due to round-off error and is acceptable.\n\nFor women:\n\nOften:\n48\n107\n=\n0.449\n≈\n45\n%\n\nSometimes:\n40\n107\n=\n0.374\n≈\n37\n%\n\nRarely:\n19\n107\n=\n0.178\n≈\n18\n%\n\nThe graph shown in Choice 'B' correctly displays these percentages by gender and is the correct choice.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This graph shows the conditional distribution of gender for each response and does so in terms of frequencies.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This graph simply shows each response as a percentage based upon the total number of individuals surveyed. There is no attempt to show how the responses are distributed by gender.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This graph shows the conditional distribution of gender for each response and does so in terms of percents.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. A scatterplot is not an appropriate type of graph for dealing with categorical variables. Also, the horizontal axis separates the three responses and then breaks them down by gender.\n\nBased upon this, we would expect to see the conditional distribution of gender for each response. However, the percents given are not consistent with this conditional distribution. Rather, they are the correct percents for the conditional distribution of responses by gender.",
