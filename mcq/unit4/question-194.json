  "solution": "A geometric distribution will always be right skewed. Regardless of the probability of success, the single most likely outcome will be success on the first trial. For each additional value ($n = 2, n = 3$, etc.), there will be a slightly lower probability of success on that trial.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
