  "question_text": "A certain prize wheel has $12\\text{ spots}$ on it.<br>Five of the spots contain cash values of $\\$500$. Five other spots contain cash values of $\\$1{,}000$. One spot contains a cash value of $\\$10{,}000$. The $12^\\text{th}$ spot represents a bankruptcy, resulting in losing all money gained from previous spins.<br>In this game, the player spins until he gets a bankruptcy or chooses to stop. One particular player has bad luck and thinks the wheel may not be balanced in a fair way so that each spot does not have the same likelihood of getting stopped on.<br>Which of the following methods of geometric simulation could determine if the player is correct?",

  "solution": "Choice 'C' is correct; this accurately meets the conditions of geometric simulation.\n\nNote that the cash values mentioned in the problem do not figure into choosing the appropriate simulation methods.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the simulation method is correct but should be more than 10 trials.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the numbers must be replaced to simulate independent events, such as spinning the wheel.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the theoretical mean is:\n\n1\nP\n=\n1\n(\n1\n12\n)\n=12\n\n...not 6.4\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; this simulation could be used to determine if the wheel is unfair, but it is not a geometric simulation, as the problem asks for.",
