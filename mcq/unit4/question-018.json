Five other spots contain cash values of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\$1{,}000$</span>. One spot contains a cash value of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\$10{,}000$</span>. The <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$12^\\text{th}$</span> spot represents a bankruptcy, resulting in losing all money gained from previous spins.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">In this game, the player spins until he gets a bankruptcy or chooses to stop. One particular player has bad luck and thinks the wheel may not be balanced in a fair way so that each spot does not have the same likelihood of getting stopped on.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of the following methods of geometric simulation could determine if the player is correct?</div>",
