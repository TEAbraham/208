  "question_text": "A certain prize wheel has $12\\text{ spots}$ on it.\nFive of the spots contain cash values of $\\$500$. Five other spots contain cash values of $\\$1{,}000$. One spot contains a cash value of $\\$10{,}000$. The $12^\\text{th}$ spot represents a bankruptcy, resulting in losing all money gained from previous spins.\nIn this game, the player spins until he gets a bankruptcy or chooses to stop. One particular player has bad luck and thinks the wheel may not be balanced in a fair way so that each spot does not have the same likelihood of getting stopped on.\nWhich of the following methods of geometric simulation could determine if the player is correct?",
