  "question_text": "Marlene works two jobs to help make ends meet.\nAs a waitress, her weekly earnings (including tips) are approximately normally distributed with a mean of $\\$590$ and a standard deviation of $\\$45$.\nAs a dog walker, her weekly earnings depend upon how many dog walks she provides that week. The number of dog walks she provides each week is a random variable (D) whose probability distribution is shown below.\nD 5 6 7 8 9 10\np(D) 0.18 0.22 0.25 0.16 0.14 0.05\n\n\nIf Marlene charges $\\$20$ per dog walk, on average, how much can she expect to make each week from both of her two jobs combined?",
