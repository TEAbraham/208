  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nA sample space is the set of all possible outcomes in a given probability model. Since we cannot see what is in each bag, we pick $3$ of them. Therefore, we can get either or both potatoes. So, both potatoes can go with either the tomato or the avocado, or these two can go with either one of the potatoes. Thus, there are $4$ possibilities in the sample space.\n\nThe probability of any item in a sample space is $1$ divided by the number of different outcomes in the same space. In this case, it is $1$ divided by $4$ which is equal to $0.25$.\n\nSo, Choice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because the $4$ items are simply listed. If this was the sample space, the probability would be true.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because the items are listed with the potatoes in the same category. The probability matches the list of $3$, but is incorrect.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because, though the sample space is correct, the probability is not. This probability is counting the potatoes as one.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because the assumption made here is that one of each item is selected. Given the sample space, the probability would be correct.",
