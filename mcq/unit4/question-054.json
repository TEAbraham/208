  "question_text": "Many collegiate athletes are tested for performance-enhancing steroids. Suppose a standard test gives a positive result for the usage of steroids $98\\%$ of the time on individuals who use steroids. However, the drug test shows a positive result for steroids when the individual is in fact not using steroids, $8\\%$ of the time. If $15\\%$ of college athletes use steroids, what is the probability that a randomly selected test result gives a positive test for steroids?",
