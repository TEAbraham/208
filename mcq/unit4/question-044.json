At this same school, $19\\%$ of students are involved in the music program and are on the honor roll.<br>If a student is selected at random from among those who participate in the school's music program, what is the probability the selected student will be on the honor roll?",

  "solution": "We are told that a student was selected from among those involved in the music program. This is a given condition.\n\nWe are looking for the probability of getting an honor roll student given the student participates in the music program. That is, we are looking for $p(\\text{honor roll} | \\text{music program})$.\n\nWe can calculate the conditional probability using the formula:\n\n$$p\\left(\\text{honor roll} | \\text{music program} \\right) =\\frac { p\\left( \\text{honor roll AND music program} \\right) }{ p\\left( \\text{music program} \\right) } =\\frac { 0.19 }{ 0.31 } =0.61$$\n\nChoice 'E' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. We cannot simply subtract the given probabilities.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This is $p(\\text{honor roll AND music program})$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. It represents $p(\\text{music program})$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. We cannot simply add the given probabilities.",
