  "solution": "When researchers begin to look at <strong>data</strong>, they understand that there will always be some <strong>variation</strong>, especially when the data is collected <strong>randomly</strong>.  Simply because the data that is collected displays a pattern at some point in the research, does not imply that data is not random. \n\nIn this case, we know the researcher collected many random samples. And while the percent that should have the recessive trait is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\"><span class=\"MathJax_Preview\" style=\"color: inherit;\"></span><span id=\"MathJax-Element-8063-Frame\" class=\"mjx-chtml MathJax_CHTML\" tabindex=\"0\" data-mathml=\"<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mn>0.5</mn><mi mathvariant=&quot;normal&quot;>&amp;#x0025;</mi></math>\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"font-size: 114%; position: relative;\"><span id=\"MJXc-Node-36720\" class=\"mjx-math\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span id=\"MJXc-Node-36721\" class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span id=\"MJXc-Node-36722\" class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.387em; padding-bottom: 0.387em;\">0.5</span></span><span id=\"MJXc-Node-36723\" class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.441em; padding-bottom: 0.387em;\">%</span></span></span></span><span class=\"MJX_Assistive_MathML\" role=\"presentation\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mn>0.5</mn><mi mathvariant=\"normal\">%</mi></math></span></span><script type=\"math/tex\" id=\"MathJax-Element-8063\">0.5\\%</script></span>, the researcher gets three positives in the first three trials.

  "distractor_explanations": {
    "B": "<strong>Choice 'B'</strong> is incorrect. While we may want to jump to the conclusion that everyone has the recessive trait since the first three did, we can most likely attribute this to the random variation in the data. ",
