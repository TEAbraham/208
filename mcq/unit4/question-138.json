  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Means can simply be added.\n\nAverage weight is 13+13+13+13=52 ounces.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. While each onion in the bag will still have a mean of 13 ounces\n, the actual bag indirectly refers to the sum of the four onions.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This selection refers to the idea of dividing the sum of means by the square root of the sample size. While this formula is used for standard deviation for a single mean, this is not used to add means.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This selection was formed by multiplying 13⋅2.6⋅4\n. While independent events can be multiplied to find certain probabilities, this question is asking for something completely different.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Standard deviations can be combined by finding the variances (by squaring the standard deviations), adding the standard deviations up, and then taking the square root of this value in order to find the standard deviation. Using this formula, the standard deviation of bags of size n=4\n, is 4.6 ounces\n, but the problem asks for the mean of these bags.",
