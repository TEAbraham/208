  "solution": "In this situation, the shooter must make three shots, and then miss the fourth. Each free-throw attempt is independent of the previous, so the probability of making the shot is 75% each time. Conversely, there is a 25% chance that he will miss.\n\nP(Score, Score, Score, Miss)\n\n=0.75∗0.75∗0.75∗0.25\n\n=0.1054\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
