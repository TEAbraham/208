  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">A factory utilizes two different production lines (<span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$A$</span> and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$B$</span>) for manufacturing gizmos. Since production line <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$A$</span> is faster, it is able to produce <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$60\\%$</span> of the gizmos, with the remaining gizmos coming off of production line <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$B$</span>. It is known that <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2\\%$</span> of the gizmos from production line <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$A$</span> and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4\\%$</span> of the gizmos from production line <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$B$</span> will contain some small defect.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Based upon this, if a gizmo is randomly selected from among all gizmos produced at this factory and the gizmo is found to have a defect, what is the probability the gizmo came off production line <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$B$</span>?</div>",
