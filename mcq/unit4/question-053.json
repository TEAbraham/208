  "question_text": "A factory utilizes two different production lines ($A$ and $B$) for manufacturing gizmos. Since production line $A$ is faster, it is able to produce $60\\%$ of the gizmos, with the remaining gizmos coming off of production line $B$. It is known that $2\\%$ of the gizmos from production line $A$ and $4\\%$ of the gizmos from production line $B$ will contain some small defect.<br>Based upon this, if a gizmo is randomly selected from among all gizmos produced at this factory and the gizmo is found to have a defect, what is the probability the gizmo came off production line $B$?",
