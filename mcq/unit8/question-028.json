  "question_text": "Jackie recently read a report claiming that $43.8\\%$ of smartphone users have an Apple iPhone, $39.6\\%$ have an Android device, $13.6\\%$ have a Blackberry, and $3\\%$ have some other type of smartphone. She wonders whether this distribution is true for students at her high school.\nTo gather data, she randomly surveyed $30\\text{ students}$ who have smartphones. She found that $15$ of them have Apple iPhones, $11$ have an Android device, $3$ have a Blackberry, and $1$ has some other type of smartphone.\nDoes this provide evidence that the distribution of smartphones at this high school is not the same as was stated in the report?",
