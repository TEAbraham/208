  "solution": "Relative frequency identifies each category as a proportion or percent of the total number of observations.\n\nThe total number of dogs is:\n\n$$28+43+35=106$$\n\nNext, calculate the relative frequency for each dog size:\n\nSmall: $\\dfrac{28}{106}=0.264\\approx26\\%$\nMedium: $\\dfrac{43}{106}=0.406\\approx41\\%$\nLarge: $\\dfrac{35}{106}=0.330\\approx33\\%$\n\nThe pie chart shown in Choice 'D' accurately displays these proportions so Choice 'D' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'A' and 'B' are both incorrect because they display the actual frequency for each dog size, not the relative frequency.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because the percents are not quite accurate and because the percents for medium sized dogs and large dogs have been reversed.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. In this situation, dog size is being reported as a categorical variable. A scatterplot is not an appropriate way to display information related to categorical data. Rather, a scatterplot can be used to show the relationship between two quantitative variables.",
