  "question_text": "Jovita was researching demographics online and found the following information about the distribution of races in her town.<br>White Non-Hispanic: $81.5\\%$\nBlack: $2.1\\%$\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native: $0.0\\%$\nAsian: $10.5\\%$\nNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: $0.0\\%$\nHispanic or Latino: $4.8\\%$\nTwo or more races: $1.0\\%$\nSome other race: $0.1\\%$<br>She wondered whether the information was correct and decided to investigate. A random sample of $245$ residents in her town (population $47,238$) provides the following counts for each category:<br>White Non-Hispanic: $181$\nBlack: $8$\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native: $5$\nAsian: $28$\nNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: $5$\nHispanic or Latino: $14$\nTwo or more races: $2$\nSome other race: $2$<br>Jovita entered the actual counts into List $1$ in her $TI84$ calculator and entered the expected counts into List $2$ after applying the appropriate percentages. While she noticed that not all expected counts were above $5$, she remembered her AP Statistics teacher telling her that she should proceed cautiously with an appropriate test even if one of the conditions for performing the test was violated. She then asked the calculator to perform a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ GOF Test but the calculator returned an error message.<br>What went wrong?",

  "solution": "This problem can be solved by the process of elimination.\n\nWhile it is possible that Jovita entered a value into her calculator incorrectly (and she should certainly check to make sure that all values were entered correctly), this is not necessarily true. Therefore, we can eliminate Choice 'A' as a possible answer.\n\nA ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ Goodness of Fit Test is used to determine if a characteristic of a certain population is distributed in the same proportions as suggested by a given model.\n\nIn this case, Jovita is interested in the distribution of races in her town. She wants to compare the proportions from her sample with the distribution found online to see if they match. A ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ Goodness of Fit Test is the appropriate test to use in this situation, so Choice 'B' can also be eliminated as a possible answer choice.\n\nA $p$-value can never be greater than (or even equal to) $1$, and the calculator would not produce this type of $p$-value. We can also eliminate Choice 'C'. As a note, however, if the $p$-value is extremely close to $1$, the calculator may actually show a $p$-value of $1$. You would need to realize that the $p$-value is not equal to exactly $1$, but is approximately $1$.\n\nChoice 'D' is worth thinking about. Is this really how the calculator would respond? The answer is no. If a $p$-value is extremely close to $0$, the calculator may actually report that the $p$-value is $0$. You need to realize that the actual value is approximately $0$. On the other hand, the calculator could have trouble dealing with numbers that are too large. For instance, if you enter ${ 100 }^{ 1000000 }$ into your calculator, you will probably get an \"overflow error\". The calculator cannot handle a number this large!\n\nChoice 'E' is also worth considering. Different books list slightly different conditions for conducting a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ Goodness of Fit Test. Some books claim that all expected counts must be at least $1$ and that no more than $20\\%$ of expected counts are less than $5$. Other books simply say that all expected counts must be at least $5$. All agree on the fact that data must come from a random sample of the population of interest. However, when completing a free response problem on the AP exam, it is important to proceed with a test even if a condition is violated since the results of some tests may not change very much - a concept known as \"robustness\". Let's think about how we would proceed.\n\nThe formula for calculating a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic can be found in the reference material provided with the A. P. Exam. The formula is given as:\n\n$$\\text{Chi-square test statistic}=\\sum { \\dfrac { { \\text{(observed-expected}) }^{ 2 } }{ \\text{expected}} } $$\n\nIn calculating the test statistic, if the expected count for a category is $0$, we will be dividing by $0$ when trying to calculating the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic. We cannot divide by $0$! That is why the calculator is giving an error message!\n\nThe information Jovita found online lists two categories as $0\\%$ which means that the expected counts for those categories would be $0$ according to the given distribution. Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
