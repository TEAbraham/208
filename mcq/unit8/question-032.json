  "question_text": "Jovita was researching demographics online and found the following information about the distribution of races in her town.<br>White Non-Hispanic: $81.5\\%$\nBlack: $2.1\\%$\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native: $0.0\\%$\nAsian: $10.5\\%$\nNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: $0.0\\%$\nHispanic or Latino: $4.8\\%$\nTwo or more races: $1.0\\%$\nSome other race: $0.1\\%$<br>She wondered whether the information was correct and decided to investigate. A random sample of $245$ residents in her town (population $47,238$) provides the following counts for each category:<br>White Non-Hispanic: $181$\nBlack: $8$\nAmerican Indian and Alaska Native: $5$\nAsian: $28$\nNative Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander: $5$\nHispanic or Latino: $14$\nTwo or more races: $2$\nSome other race: $2$<br>Jovita entered the actual counts into List $1$ in her $TI84$ calculator and entered the expected counts into List $2$ after applying the appropriate percentages. While she noticed that not all expected counts were above $5$, she remembered her AP Statistics teacher telling her that she should proceed cautiously with an appropriate test even if one of the conditions for performing the test was violated. She then asked the calculator to perform a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ GOF Test but the calculator returned an error message.<br>What went wrong?",
