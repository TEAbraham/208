  "question_text": "Suppose Kathy bought a large bag of candy that comes in four flavors: cherry, strawberry, orange, and lemon.<br>Out of the $84\\text{ pieces of candy}$, $23$ were cherry, $24$ were strawberry, $21$ were orange, and $16$ were lemon. Kathy performed a chi-squared goodness of fit test to determine if the candy flavors were evenly distributed.<br>What flavor contributed the most to the chi-squared test statistic?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "First, find the expected counts. If they were evenly distributed, each flavor would occur $25\\%$ of the time since there are four distinct flavors.\n\nOne would expect $84\\cdot 0.25 = 21\\text{ candies}$ of each flavor in every bag.\n\nFind each component of the test statistic to see that lemon contributes the most.\n\nCherry: $\\dfrac{(23-21)^2}{21} = 0.19$\n\nStrawberry: $\\dfrac{(24-21)^2}{21} = 0.43 $\n\nOrange: $\\dfrac{(21-21)^2}{21} = 0$\n\nLemon: $\\dfrac{(16-21)^2}{21} = 1.19$\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
