The data is below:<br>When performing a chi-squared goodness of fit test, the appropriate chi-squared test statistic and $p$-value are approximately what?<br>When performing a chi-squared goodness of fit test, the appropriate chi-squared test statistic and $p$-value are approximately what?",

  "solution": "The chi-squared test statistic is the summation of each difference of the observed minus expected counts squared, divided by the expected counts as given by the formula below:\n\n$$\\sum{\\dfrac{(O-E)^2 }{E}}$$\n\nSubstitute the values to get the test statistic as shown:\n\n$$=\\dfrac{(28-20.7)^2}{20.7}+\\dfrac{(38-36.8)^2}{36.8}+\\dfrac{(36-28.75)^2}{28.75}+\\dfrac{(9-23)^2}{23}+\\dfrac{(4-5.75)^2}{5.75} $$\n\n$$= 13.496$$\n\nUse the chi-squared distribution table to look up $13.51$ with $n-1 = 5-1 = 4$ to find the test statistic is between the critical values $13.28$ and $14.86$, and the upper tail probabilities are between $0.005$ and $0.01$.\n\nTo find a specific $p$-value, we can use our calculators. If you're using a TI-83 or TI-84, we can find the area under the Chi-square curve like this:\n\nWe find an exact $p$-value of around $0.009$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
