  "question_text": "A fast food company is offering a prize promotion game.<br>The company claims that in $0.5\\%$ of all orders will receive $\\$100$ cash, $1\\%$ of all orders will receive $\\$10$ cash, and $10\\%$ of orders will receive a coupon for a free soft drink. The remaining orders will receive no prizes.<br>A group of long-time customers were excited about the new promotion, and over the course of the promotion, they placed $651\\text{ orders}$. Of these orders, $2$ ended up winning $\\$100$, $6$ won $\\$10$, and $52$ won a free soft drink.<br>The group wants to do a chi-squared goodness of fit test to test the advertised odds.<br>What would be considered a type I error in the context of this problem?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The definition of a type I error is rejecting $H_0$ when in fact $H_0$ is true.\n\nAn easy way to think of a type I error is to make the change, when in fact no change should have been made. In this situation, it would mean deciding the proportions of winning by the company are NOT what they are advertised to be, when in fact they are.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; this represents a type II error.\n\nChoices 'C', 'D', and 'E' are incorrect; chi-squared tests are, by nature, two-sided and cannot claim that contestants are more or less likely to win prizes than advertised.",
