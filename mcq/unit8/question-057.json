  "solution": "Statement I is correct; if the data comes from one single sample, a chi-squared test for association will be used.\n\nStatement II is correct; if the data comes from multiple samples, a chi-squared test for homogeneity will be used.\n\nStatement III is also correct; if the data is in the form of a $2 \\times 2$ table, then a two-proportion $Z$-test could also be used.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
