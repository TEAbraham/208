  "question_text": "Suppose a random survey was taken in a large urban high school to determine if vending machine location affects whether sports drinks are more likely to be ordered.<br>A large single sample of size n = $500$ was taken over the last week. In the cafeteria, $78$ of the $165$ drinks purchased were sports drinks. In the gym, $98$ of the $157$ drinks purchased were sports drinks, and in the auditorium, $54$ of the $178$ drinks purchased were sports drinks.<br>The expected number of people who did NOT order sports drinks in the gym is?",

  "solution": "Expected counts can be found by putting the two-way table into a matrix on a TI-$83/84$ calculator, running a chi-squared test, and then going into Matrix B to find the expected counts.\n\nOtherwise, by hand, expected counts for any cell in a matrix is:\n\n$$\\dfrac{\\text{(row total)} \\times \\text{(column total)}}{\\text{(table total)}}$$\n\nThe matrix would look like the table below:\n\nThe expected count would be:\n\n$$(98 + 59) \\times \\dfrac{(87 + 59 + 124)}{500} = 84.78$$\n\nNever round expected counts, as these are used in the chi-squared test statistic calculation.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
