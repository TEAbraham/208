  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "As a class project, Statistics students have decided to investigate whether a student's choice of favorite cafeteria meal is associated with their class level. The Statistics students randomly survey students as they enter the cafeteria and ask them to select from among the following choices:<br>Pizza\nTacos\nSandwich\nSalad<br>They also ask the surveyed students to identify their class level. Results are shown in the table below.<br>The class plans to conduct a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test for association.<br>Assuming there is no association between favorite food and class level, what is the expected number of sophomores who would say that tacos is their favorite cafeteria meal?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "First, let's add the marginal distributions (totals) into the two way table.\n\nThe actual number of sophomores who said \"tacos\" is $25$. However, we are trying to determine the expected count.\n\nTo find the expected count for a particular cell in a two-way table, we use the following formula:\n\n$$EC = \\frac { \\left( row\\ total \\right) \\left( column\\ total \\right) }{ table\\ total }$$\n\nFor the cell related to sophomores and tacos, we have:\n\nRow (sophomores) $= 19 + 25 + 10 + 12 = 66$\nColumn (tacos) $= 18 + 25 + 22 + 16 = 81$\nTable $= 23 + 18 + 7 + 5 + 19 + 25 + 10 + 12 + 27 + 22 + 8 + 8 + 24 + 16 + 14 + 7 = 245$\n\nExpected Count $= \\dfrac { \\left( 66 \\right) \\left( 81 \\right) }{ 245 } = 21.82$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. We cannot simply take the total number of sophomores ($66$) divided by the number of meal choices ($4$).\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. We cannot simply take the total number who chose tacos ($81$) divided by the number of class levels ($4$).\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. While reality would tell us that a whole number is appropriate for an expected count, expected counts are not rounded when used to conduct a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. We cannot assume that the actual count is equal to the expected count.",
