Students will order a t-shirt, selecting a color (red or blue) and a size (small, medium, or large). Here is the distribution of t-shirt orders for a random sample of $178$ of the school's students:<br>The principal wants to test the claim $H_o$: Shirt Color and Size are independent. To do so, which of the following conditions must be met before the principal can use a $\\chi^2$ procedure in this situation?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe students in the sample must be chosen randomly. Values in the sample must be independent from one another. The sample must be large enough to represent the population - to determine if the sample is large, all expected counts must be at least $5$.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect: In a chi-square setting, there is no requirement for the number of categories.\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect: If every student ordered a shirt, the principal would have the results of a census. No inference would need to be done, as the results of every student at the school would be recorded.\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect: The chi-square distribution is a family of right-skewed density curves. Thus, the normal condition does not apply to chi-square settings.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect: One of the conditions for a chi-square hypothesis test is requiring all expected values to be at least $5$. The only requirement for an observed count is each observed count must be at least one.",
