  "question_text": "A local convenience store was curious that their customers' favorite vegetable is.  Last year they asked all their customers and found that $34\\%$ liked broccoli the most, $21\\%$ peas, $18\\%$ carrots, $17\\%$ cabbage, and $10\\%$ liked beans the most. Recently a random sample of $123$ vegetable-buying customers found that $39$ liked broccoli the most, $23$ peas, $20$ carrots, $17$ cabbage, and $24$ liked beans the most. A chi-squared goodness of fit test is performed and results show strong evidence ( $p < 0.01$ ) that vegetable preference has recently changed over the year. What is a major shortcoming to the conclusion that vegetable preference has recently changed over the year?",
