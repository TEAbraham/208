She had <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$50$</span> students in <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2$</span> classes. The candy company claimed that we would find <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10\\%$</span> red candies and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$20\\%$</span> yellow candies.  Well, Ms. Tracey's students found the opposite percentages in the candies!</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Do you think that this result is likely due to random variation?  And what comment below explains the yes or no answer the best?</div>",

      "text": "Yes. In bags of candy you would always expect some random variation."

    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "Yes. There was no random assignment so we cannot draw any conclusions."
    },
    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Yes. We do not know if the candies were normally distributed so we cannot make any conclusions."

    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "No. Fifty bags are a big enough sample to show statistically that the company was wrong."
    },
    {
      "letter": "E",
      "text": "No. While we might always expect some random variation, the fact that the percentages were reversed is just not likely."
