  "question_text": "It has been observed that, if you lose your cell phone, the cell phone is more likely to be returned by the finder if the wallpaper encourages the finder to react in a helpful way. An experiment is performed to investigate this. Using $300$ identical cell phones, $100$ will have a photo of a baby as the wallpaper, $100$ will have a photo of a dog as the wallpaper, and $100$ will have an inspirational quote as the wallpaper. The phones are dropped at random locations around a local university. After $24$ hours, for each type of wallpaper, the number of phones that have been returned will be recorded.\nThe entire data set will be studied using a hypothesis test. Which of the following is the most appropriate test to use?",
