Using <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$300$</span> identical cell phones, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100$</span> will have a photo of a baby as the wallpaper, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100$</span> will have a photo of a dog as the wallpaper, and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100$</span> will have an inspirational quote as the wallpaper.  The phones are dropped at random locations around a local university.  After <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$24$</span> hours, for each type of wallpaper, the number of phones that have been returned will be recorded.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">The entire data set will be studied using a hypothesis test.
