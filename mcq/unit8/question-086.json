In a one-way table, $ \\text {degrees of freedom} = (\\text {number of categories}) - 1$\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect: $108$ is the sample size taken for the study.\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect: $27800$ is the value that results when multiplying the population size of $200000$ by the population proportion of $13.9$%.",
