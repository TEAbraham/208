  "solution": "The expected counts are counts one would expect to get if the null hypothesis were true.\n\nIf the null hypothesis were true, then $18\\%$ of the sample would get As, $32\\%$ would get Bs, and so on.\n\nBy that logic,\n\n$(0.18) \\times 115 = 20.7$ would get A's\n$(0.32) \\times 115 = 36.8$ would get B's\n$(0.25) \\times 115 = 28.75$ would get C's\n$(0.2) \\times 115 = 23$ would get D's\n$(0.05) \\times 115 = 5.75$ would get F's\n\nThis matches Choice 'E'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; this gives observed counts.\n\nChoices 'B' and 'C' are incorrect; these give percentages, not counts.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; this rounds the expected counts; NEVER round the expected counts, as these expected counts are used in calculating the chi-squared test statistic.",
