  "solution": "To calculate the expected counts for a certain category, one must multiply the sample size by the proportion for that category. For instance, the manager is taking a random sample of $50$ employees and $30\\%$ of the employees are in the Accounting Department. Therefore,\n\n\n\n$$50(0.3) = 15 \\text{ employees}$$\n\nTherefore, the manager should expect $15$ employees from the Accounting department.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
