  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C\" is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "To calculate the expected counts for a certain category, one must multiply the sample size by the proportion for that category. For instance, the manager is taking a random sample of 50 50 employees and 30 % 30 % of the employees are in the Accounting Department. Therefore,\n\n\n\n50 ( 0.3 ) = 15 employees 50 ( 0.3 ) = 15 employees\n\nTherefore, the manager should expect 15 15 employees from the Accounting department.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
