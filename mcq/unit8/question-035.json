  "question_text": "The vegetable sales at a local convenience store last year broke down as follows: $34\\%$ broccoli, $21\\%$ peas, $18\\%$ carrots, $17\\%$ cabbage, and $10\\%$ beans. Recently a random sample of $123$ vegetable-buying customers found that $39$ bought broccoli, $23$ bought peas, $20$ bought carrots, $17$ bought cabbage, and $24$ bought beans. A chi-squared goodness of fit test was performed. Determine the test statistic, $p$ -value, and degrees of freedom.",
