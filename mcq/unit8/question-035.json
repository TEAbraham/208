  "solution": "First, find the expected counts:\n\nBroccoli: $123\\cdot 0.34 = 41.82$\nPeas: $123\\cdot 0.21 = 25.83 $\nCarrots: $123\\cdot 0.18 = 22.14$\nCabbage: $123\\cdot 0.17 = 20.91$\nBeans: $123\\cdot 0.1 = 12.3$\n\nThe test statistic can be found using the following formula:\n\n$$\\dfrac{(39-41.82)^2}{41.82}+\\dfrac{(23-25.83)^2}{25.83}+\\dfrac{(20-22.14)^2}{22.14}+\\dfrac{(17-20.91)^2}{20.91}+\\dfrac{(24-12.3)^2}{12.3}$$\n\n$$= 0.19+0.31+0.21+0.73+11.13 = 12.57$$\n\nWith $5$ proportions, degrees of freedom are $5-1 = 4$.\n\nThe $p$-value using the chi-squared chart is between $1\\%$ and $2\\%$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
