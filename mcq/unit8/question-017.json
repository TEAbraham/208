  "question_text": "A fast food company is offering a prize promotion game.<br>The company claims that in $0.5\\%$ of all orders will receive $\\$100$ cash, $1\\%$ of all orders will receive $\\$10$ cash, and $10\\%$ of orders will receive a coupon for a free soft drink. The remaining orders will receive no prizes.<br>A group of long-time customers were excited about the new promotion, and over the course of the promotion, they placed $651\\text{ orders}$. Of these orders, $2$ ended up winning $\\$100$, $6$ won $\\$10$, and $52$ won a free soft drink.<br>If this group wanted to do a chi-squared goodness of fit test to test the advertised odds, what would be the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "A chi-squared goodness of fit test must always by nature have a two-sided alternative. Chi-squared tests can never test a certain direction (one being greater or less than it should be).\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'B' and 'C' are incorrect; see above explanation.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' are incorrect; these point toward a test for association/independence, which can only be completed when dealing with two categorical variables. This problem, however, concerns only one categorical variable (prize distribution).",
