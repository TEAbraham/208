  "question_text": "The vendor at a baseball game wants to determine if there is a relationship between the items sold and the inning of the game in which the sale takes place. To do so, he records the items sold and the inning the sale takes place over the course of an entire season. He then takes a random sample of every inning from the entire season and gathers his data. The two-way table below gives the results of his study.<br>He wishes to test the null hypothesis: Ho: There is no association between item sold and inning of sale.\nWhat is the $P$-value for this test?<br>What is the $P$-value for this test?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn a chi-square test for association, under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, the $P$-value gives the probability of obtaining a $\\chi^2$ test statistic value as extreme as or more extreme than the one found in this study.\n\nThe $P$-value of a chi-square test is found by calculating the area to the right of the chi-square test statistic. This can be done using several calculator functions and commands.\n\nWhen analyzing the results given in a two-way table, the matrix function can be used to input the data into the calculator. Next, the $\\chi^2$ Test is done, resulting in a $\\chi^2$ test statistic of $15.327$ and a $P$-value of $0.0041$.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect: $15.327$ is the value of the $\\chi^2$ test statistic.\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect: This gives the complement of the $P$-value, or the area to the left of the $\\chi^2$ test statistic.\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect: $0.05$ is a commonly used value of $\\alpha$, the level of significance used in some hypothesis tests.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect: $4$ is the correct value for the degrees of freedom for this set of data.",
