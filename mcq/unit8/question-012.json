  "solution": "Statement I is incorrect; a chi-squared test is usually performed on a single sample, or can be performed on multiple samples or an experiment where subjects are randomly assigned into different groups. However, the sample does not HAVE to be 2 independent random samples\n\nStatement II is correct. This is a condition necessary for Chi Squared. Some textbooks add that all expected counts must be over 1, and no more than 20% of expected counts can be less than 5. However, the general consensus is that all expected counts must be at least 5.\n\nStatement III is incorrect. That is correct for 1 proportion Z procedures, but not Chi Squared.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
