  "question_text": "A very enthusiastic football fan wonders if there is a birth month that will give her baby the best chances of making it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. To investigate, she conducts a hypothesis test to see if the distribution of birth months of players in the Hall of Fame is uniform across all $12\\text{ months}$ of the year.\nWhich distribution should she use in her analysis? Why?",
