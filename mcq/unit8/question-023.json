  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "A very enthusiastic football fan wonders if there is a birth month that will give her baby the best chances of making it into the Pro Football Hall of Fame. To investigate, she conducts a hypothesis test to see if the distribution of birth months of players in the Hall of Fame is uniform across all $12\\text{ months}$ of the year.<br>Which distribution should she use in her analysis? Why?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Because the football fan is interested in comparing the number of births for $12\\text{ months}$ (categories), a Chi-square Goodness-of-Fit test is most appropriate here.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nA $t$-distribution is appropriate for hypothesis tests involving one or two means. Choice 'C' is incorrect.\n\nA $z$-distribution is appropriate for hypothesis tests involving one or two proportions, or in hypothesis tests where the standard deviation of the population is known. Choices 'A' and 'B' are incorrect.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because this experiment is comparing categories, not proportions.",
