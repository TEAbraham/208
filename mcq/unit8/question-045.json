  "question_text": "Suppose a random survey was taken in a large urban high school to determine if vending machine location affects whether sports drinks are more likely to be ordered.<br>A large single sample of size $n = 500$ was taken over the last week. In the cafeteria, $78$ of the $165$ drinks purchased were sports drinks. In the gym, $98$ of the $157$ drinks purchased were sports drinks, and in the auditorium, $54$ of the $178$ drinks purchased were sports drinks.<br>The appropriate degrees of freedom for this chi-squared distribution is?",

  "solution": "For a two-way table, degrees of freedom will be:\n\n$$(r-1) \\times (c-1)$$\n\n...where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns.\n\nSince this is a $3 \\times 2$ table, the appropriate degrees of freedom will be:\n\n$$(3-1) \\times (2-1) = 2$$\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
