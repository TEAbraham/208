  "solution": "This accurately uses a two-proportion z-test.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; there are two independent proportions (males AND females).\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; the survey asks which candidate is preferred, which will be represented by sample proportions, not sample means.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; if this were a two-sided test, this answer would be appropriate; but this is a one-sided test to determine whether females prefer Democrats.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; the problem deals with two variables (gender and candidate); a chi-squared goodness of fit test examines several proportions within one variable.",
