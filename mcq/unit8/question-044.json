  "question_text": "Suppose a high school principal wishes to determine if students in her after-school math program perform better than those not in the program.<br>The principal randomly selected $115\\text{ students}$ for an after-school study session that runs $3\\text{ days per week}$ for $1\\text{ hour}$ each day, focusing solely on math.<br>The grade distribution of these students’ math grades is compared to the historical grade distribution of students’ math grades at this high school. The data is below:<br>What are appropriate alternative and null hypotheses for this problem if the principal wishes to perform a chi-squared goodness of fit test?<br>What are appropriate alternative and null hypotheses for this problem if the principal wishes to perform a chi-squared goodness of fit test?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Choices 'A' and 'B' are incorrect; chi-squared tests cannot give one-sided results.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; these would be the hypotheses for a one-proportion $Z$-test.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; there is only one variable (grades of those in the program) to compare to a historical average.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
