  "question_text": "Suppose a high school principal wishes to determine if students in her after-school math program perform better than those not in the program. The principal randomly selected $115\\text{ students}$ for an after-school study session that runs $3\\text{ days per week}$ for $1\\text{ hour}$ each day, focusing solely on math. The grade distribution of these students’ math grades is compared to the historical grade distribution of students’ math grades at this high school. The data is below: A B C D F After-School Program (Counts) 28 38 36 9 4 Historical Grade Distribution (%) 18% 32% 25% 20% 5% What are appropriate alternative and null hypotheses for this problem if the principal wishes to perform a chi-squared goodness of fit test?",
