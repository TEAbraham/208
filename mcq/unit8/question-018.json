  "question_text": "Suppose a random survey was taken in a large urban high school to determine if vending machine location affects whether sports drinks are more likely to be ordered. A large single sample of size n = $500$ was taken over the last week. In the cafeteria, $78$ of the $165$ drinks purchased were sports drinks. In the gym, $98$ of the $157$ drinks purchased were sports drinks, and in the auditorium, $54$ of the $178$ drinks purchased were sports drinks. What are the appropriate null and alternative hypotheses?",
