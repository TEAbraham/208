  "solution": "A test for homogeneity of populations begins with the null hypothesis that the distribution of proportions related to a specific variable is the same for all populations being tested. If $p < 0.05$, we would have reason to reject this hypothesis.\n\nFirst, we must determine the number of degrees of freedom to use. Since our data is coming from a two-way table, we calculate the degrees of freedom as $(r – 1)(c – 1)$ where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns. Here, $r = 6$ and $c = 3$. Therefore, $df = (6 – 1)(3 – 1) = (5)(2) = 10$.\n\nTo find the $p$-value, we can either use the chi-square table or the TI83/84 graphing calculator.\n\nTo use the table, look down the column to find $df = 10$, then look across the row to find a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $19.63$. You will not be able to find $19.63$ in this row, but you will be able to notice that it falls between $18.31$ and $20.48$, which are the two closest values with $df = 10$.\n\nLook to the top of the columns above $18.31$ and $20.48$ and see that the related probabilities are $0.05$ and $0.025$. From this, we know that the actual $p$-value is between $0.025$ and $0.05$.\nTo use the graphing calculator, we will need to use the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$cdf function.\n\nThe syntax is: ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$cdf(${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value, upper bound, df).\n\nIn this case, you would:\n\nSince our $p$-value is less than $0.05$, we do have good reason to believe that the populations are not homogeneous. That is, we have evidence to believe that the distribution of proportions is not the same throughout all populations being tested.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The $p$-value here was calculated using $(r)(c) = (6)(3) = 18$ degrees of freedom.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This answer assumes that the $p$-value and ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value are the same. This is not true. Also, remember that a $p$-value is always less than $1$. A $p$-value of $19.63$ makes no sense.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' are incorrect because we are not testing for the independence of populations. Choice 'D' also provides incorrect information about the $p$-value.",
