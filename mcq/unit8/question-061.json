  "question_text": "Hector has been assigned to do a chi-square test for independence for his university's statistics class. He has decided to see if there is an association between class year and grade point average, with grade point average split into $3$ categories. He plans to sample $100$ students thinking that this number will give him high enough cell counts. The following five answers contain a hypothesis and a condition for his test. Four of the $5$ answers contain an incorrect statement. Find the answer which is fully correct.",
