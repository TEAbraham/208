Data must come from a random sample or random samples.<br>II. Expected counts must all be greater than $1$, and no more than $20\\%$ of expected counts can be less than $5$.<br>III. $np$ and $n(1-p)$ must both be greater than $5$ where $n$ is the number of trials and $p$ is the proportion of successes.",

  "solution": "Statements I and II are true; these are the conditions necessary for a chi-squared procedure involving two-way tables.\n\nStatement III is false; this is a necessary condition for a test involving a single proportion, not chi-squared procedures.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
