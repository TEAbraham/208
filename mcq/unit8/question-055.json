  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe chi-square test for homogeneity looks to see if there are differences in distributions of a categorical variable across populations\n\nThe null hypothesis for this test assumes that there is no difference in distributions of a categorical variable across populations.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis for this test assumes that there is a difference in distributions of a categorical variable across populations.\n\nNote that if only two populations are involved, then a test for a difference in population proportions could also be done.\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because this is the alternative hypothesis for the chi-square test for independence.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because this is the null hypothesis for the chi-square test for goodness of fit.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because this is the alternative hypothesis for the chi-square test for homogeneity.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because this is the null hypothesis for the chi-square test for independence.",
