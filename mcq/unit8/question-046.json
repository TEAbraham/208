  "solution": "If different dog sizes are being adopted at the same rate, then one-third of the adoptions should be for small dogs, one-third for medium dogs and one-third for large dogs. The appropriate test is a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test for goodness of fit, and we are told to assume that the necessary conditions have been satisfied.\n\nThe ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic can be calculated as follows:\n\n$$\\text{Chi-square test statistic} = \\dfrac{\\text{(observed-expected)}^{2}}{\\text{expected}}$$\n\nNOTE: This formula can be found in the reference materials provided with the AP Exam.\n\nThe total number of dogs for which data was recorded is:\n\n$$28+43+35=106$$\n\nThe expected count for each size is:\n\n$$\\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ 3 } \\right) (106)=35.33$$\n\nCalculate the test statistic:\n\n$${ \\chi }^{ 2 }=\\dfrac { { \\left( 28-35.33 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 35.33 } +\\dfrac { { \\left( 43-35.33 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 35.33 } +\\dfrac { { \\left( 35-35.33 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 35.33 } =3.189$$\n\nTo calculate the $p$-value, we must first determine the degrees of freedom. For a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test for goodness of fit, $\\text{df}=n-1$ where $\\text{n}$ is the number of different categories. Here, $\\text{df}=3-1=2$\n\nAll ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ distributions are right skewed and we always look for the probability of obtaining a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value that is greater than what we actually obtained. Therefore, we are looking for $p({\\chi }^{ 2 }>3.189)$.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to use the $TI83/84$ calculator's ${ \\chi }^{ 2 } cdf$ function. The syntax is: ${ \\chi }^{ 2 } cdf(\\text{test statistic, upper bound, df})$. There is no upper bound, so we will use a very large number to ensure accuracy. The instructions are:\n\nPress $2\\text{nd}$\nPress $\\text{VARS(Distr)}$\nChoose ${ \\chi }^{ 2 } cdf$\nEnter $3.189, { 10 }^{ 99 }, 2$\nEnter\n\nThe calculator returns the correct $p$-value of $p=0.203$.\n\nYou might also be able to run the test on your calculator in order to obtain the $p$-value. Not all calculators have this option. However, using the $TI-84+$ you could follow these instructions.\n\nPress STAT\nPress Enter\nWhile in $L1$, enter the counts for each category of dog by doing the following:\nType $28$ and press Enter\nType $43$ and press Enter\nType $35$ and press Enter\nThen move to $L2$ to enter the expected counts by doing the following:\nType $35.33$ and press Enter until you have entered this value $3$ times\nNow Press STAT\nHighlight TESTS\nChoose ${\\chi}^{2}\\text{GOF-TEST}$\nPress Enter\nCheck to make sure $L1$ shows next to \"Observed\"\nCheck to make sure $L2$ shows next to \"Expected\"\nEnter $2$ next to \"df\"\nHighlight Calculate\nPress Enter\n\nThe calculator will return the $p$-value of $p=0.203$.\n\nAs one more alternative, we could also estimate this value using the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ table found in the reference materials provided with the AP Exam. To use the table, look down the first column to find $\\text{df}=2$.\n\nMove across this row to look for a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 } $ statistic of $3.189$. While this value will not be found in the table, we know that $3.189$ is between $2.77$ and $3.22$ which are values that are found in the table!\n\nAbove the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic of $2.77$ we find the upper tail probability to be $0.25$. Above the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic of $3.22$ we find the upper tail probability to be $0.20$. Our $p$-value must be somewhere between $0.025$ and $0.20$. Choice 'B' is the only appropriate choice.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and would the be result obtained by using $\\text{df} = 1$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect and would the be result obtained by using $\\text{df} = 3$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and would the be result obtained by using $\\text{df} = 105$. Your calculator may even return a $p$-value of $p=1$. However, the actual $p$-value is just really, really, close to $1$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and is the value of the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic. A $p$-value cannot be larger than (or even equal to) $1$.",
