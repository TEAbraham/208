  "question_text": "The table below displays the marital status of people age 15 and over as reported by the U. S. Census Bureau (2012).<br>Tabitha wonders whether this distribution accurately represents people in her town. To investigate, she selects $90$ adults that she meets in the town library, explains that she is doing a statistical study, and asks them to describe their marital status. Of those she surveyed, $50$ said they were married, $21$ said they were never married, $14$ said they were divorced, $3$ said they were widowed, and $2$ said they were separated.<br>Tabitha realizes that people who are at the library may in some ways be similar, but she is willing to accept that her sample was randomly selected. Also, she has already determined that all other conditions for performing her hypothesis test have been satisfied.<br>What $p$-value will Tabitha obtain from her test?",

  "solution": "We are looking to compare gathered data against a specific model – namely the distribution of marital status provided by the U. S. Census Bureau. This model is provided using a table where all the percentages add up to $100\\%$.\n\nFurthermore, the variable of interest (marital status) is categorical. All of these things should lead us to conclude that a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ Goodness of Fit Test is appropriate. We are told that all conditions for performing this test may be considered as satisfied.\n\nFor this type of test, the number of degrees of freedom ($df$) is $k – 1$ where $k$ is the number of different categories the variable can fall into. There are $5$ different categories for marital status, therefore: $5 – 1 = 4$ degrees of freedom.\n\nIn order to calculate our ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic, we first need to determine expected counts for each category of marital status using the Census Bureau's model as our guide.\n\nExpected Counts are:\n\nMarried: $(90)(0.507) = 45.63$\nNever Married: $(90)(0.312) = 28.08$\nDivorced: $(90)(0.101) = 9.09$\nWidowed: $(90)(0.057) = 5.13$\nSeparated: $(90)(0.023) = 2.07$\n\nNow we need to calculate our ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic. The formula is:\n\n$${ \\chi }^{ 2 } = \\sum { \\frac { { \\left( observed - expected \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ expected } } $$\n\nFilling in the formula:\n\n$${ \\chi }^{ 2 } = \\frac { { \\left( 50-45.63 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 45.63 } +\\frac { { \\left( 21-28.08 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 28.08 } +\\frac { { \\left( 14-9.09 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 9.09 } +\\frac { { \\left( 3-5.13 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 5.13 } +\\frac { { \\left( 2-2.07 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 2.07 } = 5.74$$\n\nTo find the $p$-value, you can use the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ table or your TI-83/84 graphing calculator. To use the table, look down the column to find $df = 4$, then look across the row.\n\nYou will not find a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $5.74$, but you will notice that it falls between the two values shown of $5.39$ and $5.99$. Look to the tops of the columns containing these two values.\n\nYou will see that a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $5.39$ corresponds with a $p$-value of $0.25$ and a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $5.99$ corresponds with a $p$-value of $0.20$. Therefore, our ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $5.74$ corresponds with a $p$-value that is between $0.20$ and $0.25$.\n\nYou would then select Choice 'B', since it is the only possible answer from the choices provided.\n\nUsing the TI83/84 graphing calculator and the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$cdf function, the syntax is: ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$cdf(${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value, upper bound, df).\n\nIn this case, you would:\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and was calculated using $df = 3$. We only use $n – 2$ degrees of freedom for a $t$-test for linear regression. In that case, $n$ is the number of observations.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect and was calculated using $df = 5$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and was calculated using $df = 6$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and was calculated using $df = 89$. Although there are $90$ observations, we do not use $n – 1$ degrees of freedom in a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ Test for Goodness of Fit. We would use $n – 1$ degrees of freedom in a $t$-test for a population mean.",
