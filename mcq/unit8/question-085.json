  "question_text": "Tommy has gotten pulled over a few times for minor traffic violations and every time he has been pulled over, the officer gave him a ticket. His wife Gina has also been pulled over a few times for minor traffic violations, but she has never gotten a ticket!<br>Tommy wonders whether a police officer's actions during a traffic stop for a minor violation depends upon the driver's gender. To investigate, he selects a random sample of drivers who have been pulled over at some point for a minor traffic violation and asks them what the outcome was. Results are shown in the table below.<br>Tommy decides to conduct a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test for independence.<br>What will the resulting $p$-value be?",

  "solution": "Our hypotheses would be:\n\n${ H }_{ 0 }:$ The outcome of a traffic stop for a minor violation is independent of the gender of the driver.\n\n${ H }_{ a }:$ The outcome of a traffic stop for a minor violation depends on the gender of the driver.\n\nFirst, we must check that the conditions for performing this test are satisfied.\n\n$i.$ Our data comes from random sampling. It is stated in the problem that this is the case.\n\n$ii.$ All expected counts are at least $1$. We need to check this by calculating the expected counts for each cell in our two-way table. We find the expected counts using the formula:\n\n$$EC = \\frac { \\left( \\text{row total} \\right) \\left( \\text{column total }\\right) }{ \\text{table total} } $$\n\nFor example, the expected count for males who would be ticketed is:\n\n$$EC = \\frac { \\left( 84 \\right) \\left( 64 \\right) }{ 153 } = 35.137$$\n\nShown below are the expected counts for all cells.\n\nFrom this we can see that condition $ii$ is satisfied.\n\n$iii.$ No more than $20\\%$ of the expected counts are less than $5$. This can also be verified from the expected counts shown in the table above.\n\nNow we need to calculate our ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic. The formula is:\n\n$${ \\chi }^{ 2 } = \\sum { \\frac { { \\left( \\text{observed - expected} \\right) }^{ 2 } }{\\text{ expected} } }$$\n\nFilling in the formula:\n\n$${ \\chi }^{ 2 } = \\frac { { \\left( 38-35.137 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 35.137 } +\\frac { { \\left( 17-22.51 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 22.51 } +\\frac { { \\left( 29-26.353 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 26.353 } +\\frac { { \\left( 26-28.863 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 28.863 } +\\frac { { \\left( 24-18.49 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 18.49 } +\\frac { { \\left( 19-21.647 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 21.647 } = 4.097$$\n\nTo find the $p$-value, we must also know the degrees of freedom. From a $2$-way table, $df = (r – 1)(c – 1)$ where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns. Here, $r = 2$ and $c = 3$, so $df = (2 – 1)(3 – 1) = 2$.\n\nUsing the $\\chi^2$ table, we can look down the column to find $df = 2$. Look across the row and notice that a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $4.097$ falls between the shown values of $3.79$ and $4.61$. Match these values up with their related probabilities by looking to the top of the column they are in.\n\nA value of $3.79$ matches up with $p = 0.15$ and a value of $4.61$ matches up with $p = 0.10$. Our ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $4.097$ would then correspond with a $p$-value somewhere between $0.10$ and $0.15$.\n\nWe can also find this $p$-value using our TI83/84 graphing calculator and the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$cdf function. The syntax is: ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$cdf(${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value, upper bound, df).\n\nIn this case, you would:\n\nEnter again and your calculator will return the $p$-value of $p = 0.129$.\n\nNOTE: for a free-response problem, it is important to show all work. However, on a multiple choice problem of this nature, the entire process could be completed using the TI83/84 graphing calculator.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\nThe calculator gives you the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $4.097$, $p = 0.129$, and $df = 2$. It has also calculated all of the expected counts for you. They can be found in matrix $B$.\n\nTo see them:\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' was calculated using $df = 3$.\n\nChoice 'C' was calculated using $df = 5$.\n\nChoice 'D' was calculated using $df = 6$. Alternatively, you may have arrived at this answer by including the marginal distributions (totals) in your two-way table and entering them as part of a $3$x$4$ matrix.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Conditions were checked above and found to be satisfied.",
