  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nStudying categorical often involves understanding the relationship between two categorical variables. In this case, the two variables are \"grade level\" and \"participation in the science club.\"\n\nIf participation in the science club by different grade levels is truly random, then the distribution of students from each grade level should reflect the overall distribution of students in the school. This is where \"expected counts\" come into play.\n\nChoice 'B', \"Given the school's distribution, what's the expected club participation by grade?\", directly inquires about expected counts. The expected counts represent the number of students we would expect from each grade level in the science club if participation was random and proportionate to the overall school distribution ($25\\%$ each).\n\nBy comparing the expected counts with the actual observed counts, we can see if there is a difference. Significant differences might indicate that the participation isn't as random as it should be, suggesting a potential pattern or trend in who joins the science club based on grade level.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This question focuses on a general comparison between two grade levels and their involvement in all extracurriculars, not just the science club.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This question diverts from the primary focus of determining randomness in science club participation across grade levels. Instead, it introduces a new variable by comparing science club participation to other clubs.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This question only focuses on the comparison between two specific grade levels rather than examining the overall distribution across all grade levels. While it touches on proportionality, it doesn't provide a comprehensive view of randomness in participation for the entire science club based on the school's grade distribution.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This question introduces the concept of restrictions or limitations, which is not directly related to determining the randomness of participation. This choice is more about external constraints and not the inherent randomness of participation.",
