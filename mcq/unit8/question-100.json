  "question_text": "Market researchers know that background music can influence the mood and purchasing behavior of customers. One study in a supermarket in Syracuse compared three treatments: no music, smooth jazz music, and upbeat reggae music.<br>Under each condition, the researchers recorded the number of bottles of white, red, and other wine purchased. Here is the two-way table that summarizes the data.<br>To determine if there an association between the type of wine purchased and the type of music playing, the researchers run an appropriate test and calculate a $P$-value of $0.032$. What is the correct interpretation of this $P$-value?<br>To determine if there an association between the type of wine purchased and the type of music playing, the researchers run an appropriate test and calculate a $P$-value of $0.032$.

  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn a chi-square test for association or independence, the null hypothesis states the two categorical variables have no association or are independent. Under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, a $P$-value of $0.032$ means that there is a $3.2 \\%$ chance of obtaining a $\\chi^2$ test statistic value as extreme as or more extreme than the one found in this study.\n\nSo, Choice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect: The P-value gives the likelihood of obtaining a test statistic (or one more extreme) that represents all the data, rather than just the probability of purchasing red wine.\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect: The P-value gives the likelihood of obtaining a test statistic (or one more extreme) that represents all the data, rather than just the data related to one variable\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect: The null hypothesis states the two categorical variables have no association.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect: The P-value is the probability of obtaining the value of the test statistic OR a value more extreme. In the case of a chi-square distribution, values that count as \"more extreme\" are those that are greater than the test statistic value.",
