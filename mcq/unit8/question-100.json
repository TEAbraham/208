  "question_text": "Market researchers know that background music can influence the mood and purchasing behavior of customers. One study in a supermarket in Syracuse compared three treatments: no music, smooth jazz music, and upbeat reggae music.\nUnder each condition, the researchers recorded the number of bottles of white, red, and other wine purchased. Here is the two-way table that summarizes the data.\nType of Music None Jazz Reggae Total\nWhite $16$ $13$ $20$ $49$\nRed $10$ $21$ $12$ $43$\nOther $20$ $9$ $14$ $43$\nTo determine if there an association between the type of wine purchased and the type of music playing, the researchers run an appropriate test and calculate a $P$-value of $0.032$. What is the correct interpretation of this $P$-value?",
