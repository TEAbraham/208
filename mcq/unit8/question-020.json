  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe chi-square test for goodness of fit measures the fit between what is expected and what is observed. It is a test of significance that has hypotheses and expected values.\n\nThe null hypothesis states that the proportions are what is expected. In this case, we would expect the 6\ncolors to show up in candy bags in the same proportions as stated by the company. The alternative hypothesis states that these proportions are not the same as what the company claims.\n\nTo calculate expected values you would multiply the given proportions times the number examined. In this case we expect 15%\npurple candies so (0.15)(960)=144\ncandies.\n\nSo, Choice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because\nH\na\nhere is actually what\nH\n0\nshould be. And, the expected value should be based on the total number of candies, not the number of bags used.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because the expected value should be based on the total number of candies, not the number of bags used.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because\nH\na\nstates something which is not true.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because\nH\na\nhere is actually what\nH\n0\nshould be. And, the wrong percentage value was used, red instead of purple.",
