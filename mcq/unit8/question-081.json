  "question_text": "A student wondered if there was an association between relationship status and overall letter grade (based on grade point average) at her high school. She used a stratified random sample to select $20$ students within each letter grade. The information is displayed in the table below.<br>A ${ \\chi}^{2}$ test of independence was conducted to determine whether the data above provides convincing evidence of an association between relationship status and overall letter grade. The ${ \\chi}^{2}$ test statistic was $5.849$ with a $p$-value of $0.211$.\nWhich of the following statements is true?",
