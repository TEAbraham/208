  "solution": "The null hypothesis ${H}_{0}$ is always the statement of “no difference.” It states the status quo of a population or sample if no treatment were applied, or if an applied treatment had no effect.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; it describes the alternative hypothesis.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; this gives a description of the $p$-value, not the null hypothesis.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; validity of an experiment is usually built in during the design phase of an experiment.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; the null hypothesis does not address the effectiveness of any treatment.",
