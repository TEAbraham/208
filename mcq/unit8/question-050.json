  "solution": "When the question says under the null hypothesis that age range and orange soda interest are independent it means that each age group should have the same percentage of people in the categories of 'Interested', 'Lying but Interested', and 'Not Interested'.\n\nWe must calculate the percentage of people in each of the categories of interest:\n\n$\\dfrac{1145}{1989} = 57.6\\%$ of all people surveyed were Interested.\n\n$\\dfrac{750}{1989} = 37.7\\%$ are Lying but Interested.\n\n$\\dfrac{94}{1989} =\\mathbf{ 4.7\\%}$ of people surveyed are Not Interested.\n\nUnder the null hypothesis, we would expect $4.7\\%$ of the $811\\text{ college students}$ to be 'Not Interested.'\n\nWe would then multiply:\n\n$$811 \\times 4.7\\% = 38.117$$\n\nIf you did not round, you would get $38.327$.\n\nThe closest response is Choice 'B'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is the Observed Value for the amount of College Students who are Not Interested. This question is asking for the Expected Value, not the Observed Value.\n\nChoice 'C' takes the proportion of College Students who are Not Interested and multiplies this by the Total Number of College Students.\n\n$\\dfrac{22}{94} = 23.4\\%$ and multiplies 23.4% by the 811 total College Students surveyed.\n\nChoice 'D' assumes that all nine cells will have the same value.\n\n$\\dfrac{1989}{9} = 189.9\\%$\n\nThis answer assumes that the survey has an equal number of High School, College, and 22 Year Olds. We do not need to assume that the survey has an equal number of people from each range. The question tells us that this is not true.\n\nChoice 'E' assumes that College Students will choose the three categories in equal numbers.\n\n$\\dfrac{811}{3} = 270.3\\%$\n\nThe percentage of people who are Interested in Orange Soda should be equal for each age range.",
