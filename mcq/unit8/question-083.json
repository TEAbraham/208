  "question_text": "Suppose a high school principal wishes to determine if students in her after-school math program perform better than those not in the program.<br>The principal randomly selected $115\\text{ students}$ for an after-school study session that runs $3\\text{ days per week}$ for $1\\text{ hour}$ each day, focusing solely on math.<br>The grade distribution of these students’ math grades is compared to the historical grade distribution of students’ math grades at this high school. The data is below:<br>When performing a chi-squared test for goodness of fit, suppose strong evidence exists that students in the program have math grades different than everybody else does.<br>What kind of test would one use to prove the claim that the course actually improves math grades?",

  "solution": "Remember, a chi-squared goodness of fit test gives only two-sided results.\n\nTo attempt to show the program helps, one could do a one-proportion $Z$-test on the proportion of those in the program with A's compared to everybody else. Additional one-proportion $Z$-tests can be performed with the rest of the grades (B's, C's, and so on).\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; when dealing with two proportions, a two-proportion test may be appropriate. However, this table deals with several proportions on a single variable.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; a linear regression $T$-test is suited for quantitative data, not the categorical data in this table.\n\nChoice 'D' and 'E' and both incorrect; ANY chi-squared test is two-sided and will not test for improvement.",
