Forty homes are treated with chemical A, and another forty are treated with chemical B. Forty homes are treated with a mixture of chemicals A and B, and another forty homes are treated with nothing (as a control group). Six months after the chemicals were used, the homes were examined to determine if all the termites were exterminated.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">This information is represented in the table below:\n<br>  </div><div class=\"markdown-table-wrapper\"><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\"></th><th scope=\"col\">Termites Exterminated</th><th scope=\"col\">Termites NOT Exterminated</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Chemical A</td><td>28</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical B</td><td>27</td><td>13</td></tr><tr><td>Both Chemicals A and B</td><td>28</td><td>12</td></tr><tr><td>Neither Chemical  (control)</td><td>7</td><td>33</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><div class=\"paragraph\"><br>Assume the homes were randomly selected and that each had a similar termite condition.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which cell contributes most to the chi-squared test statistic?</div>",
