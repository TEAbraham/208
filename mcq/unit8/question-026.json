  "question_text": "Termites are starting to become a big problem in a large city. Two different chemicals, chemicals A and B, are typically used to exterminate termites. Forty homes are treated with chemical A, and another forty are treated with chemical B. Forty homes are treated with a mixture of chemicals A and B, and another forty homes are treated with nothing (as a control group). Six months after the chemicals were used, the homes were examined to determine if all the termites were exterminated. This information is represented in the table below: Termites Exterminated Termites NOT Exterminated Chemical A 28 12 Chemical B 27 13 Both Chemicals A and B 28 12 Neither Chemical  (control) 7 33 Assume the homes were randomly selected and that each had a similar termite condition. Which cell contributes most to the chi-squared test statistic?",
