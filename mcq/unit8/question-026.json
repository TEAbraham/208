  "question_text": "Termites are starting to become a big problem in a large city.<br>Two different chemicals, chemicals A and B, are typically used to exterminate termites. Forty homes are treated with chemical A, and another forty are treated with chemical B. Forty homes are treated with a mixture of chemicals A and B, and another forty homes are treated with nothing (as a control group). Six months after the chemicals were used, the homes were examined to determine if all the termites were exterminated.<br>This information is represented in the table below:<br>Assume the homes were randomly selected and that each had a similar termite condition.<br>Which cell contributes most to the chi-squared test statistic?",

  "solution": "Referring to the previous problem's explanation, we know that the expected values are:\n\n\n\nThe largest component of the test statistic is termites not exterminated with neither chemical:\n\n$$\\dfrac{(33-17.5)^2}{17.5} = 13.73$$\n\nThis corresponds to termites not exterminated when neither chemical is used.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
