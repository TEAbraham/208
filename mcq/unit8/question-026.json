  "question_text": "Termites are starting to become a big problem in a large city.\nTwo different chemicals, chemicals A and B, are typically used to exterminate termites. Forty homes are treated with chemical A, and another forty are treated with chemical B. Forty homes are treated with a mixture of chemicals A and B, and another forty homes are treated with nothing (as a control group). Six months after the chemicals were used, the homes were examined to determine if all the termites were exterminated.\nThis information is represented in the table below:\nTermites Exterminated Termites NOT Exterminated\nChemical A 28 12\nChemical B 27 13\nBoth Chemicals A and B 28 12\nNeither Chemical (control) 7 33\n\n\nAssume the homes were randomly selected and that each had a similar termite condition.\nWhich cell contributes most to the chi-squared test statistic?",
