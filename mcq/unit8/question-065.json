She is awake and active well into the night but hates getting up the next morning.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Joe and Eve started to wonder whether gender has anything to do with preferences for morning or night.  To investigate, they interviewed a random sample of individuals and asked them to identify themselves as being either more of an early bird or more of a night owl. The results of their survey are organized in the two-way table below:\n<br>  </div><div class=\"markdown-table-wrapper\"><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\"></th><th scope=\"col\">Early Bird</th><th scope=\"col\">Night Owl</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Male</td><td>48</td><td>46</td></tr><tr><td>Female</td><td>47</td><td>53</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><div class=\"paragraph\"><br>If gender and preference for time of day are independent, which of the following statements is most likely not true?</div>",
