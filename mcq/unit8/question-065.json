  "question_text": "Joe is an early bird.  He is up at the crack of dawn and ready to begin his day!  His sister, Eve, however, is a night owl.  She is awake and active well into the night but hates getting up the next morning. Joe and Eve started to wonder whether gender has anything to do with preferences for morning or night.  To investigate, they interviewed a random sample of individuals and asked them to identify themselves as being either more of an early bird or more of a night owl. The results of their survey are organized in the two-way table below: Early Bird Night Owl Male 48 46 Female 47 53 If gender and preference for time of day are independent, which of the following statements is most likely not true?",
