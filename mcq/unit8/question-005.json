  "solution": "When dealing with categorical data, one can find the expected counts of the distribution by taking a sample size and multiplying it by the proportion for that category. In this case, we are told there is a random sample of 200 200 customers, and we already know from the table that 34 % 34 % of customers prefer to use their phone. Therefore, to find the expected number of customers who prefer phone,\n\nExpected Counts = 200 ( 0.34 ) = 68 Customers Expected Counts = 200 ( 0.34 ) = 68 Customers\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
