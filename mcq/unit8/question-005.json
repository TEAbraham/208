In this case, we are told there is a random sample of $200$ customers, and we already know from the table that $34\\%$ of customers prefer to use their phone. Therefore, to find the expected number of customers who prefer phone,\n\n$\\text{Expected Counts } = 200(0.34) = 68 \\text{ Customers}$\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
