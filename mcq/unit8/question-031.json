  "solution": "The formula to find the test statistic for ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ is:\n\n$$\\sum { { \\frac { \\text{(Observed-Expected)} }{ \\text{Expected} } }^{ 2 } } $$\n\nThe problem states the politician expects the percentage of his supporters to be evenly divided among the three groups. In this case the expected number of supporters for each group will be $\\frac { 120 }{ 3 } =40$.\n\nSubstitute the values into the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ formula:\n\n$${ \\frac { (27-40) }{ 40 } }^{ 2 }+{ \\frac { (34-40) }{ 40 } }^{ 2 }+{ \\frac { (59-40) }{ 40 } }^{ 2 }=14.15$$\n\nAlternative Approach using the TI-84:\nEnter your observed counts into List 1.\nEnter your expected counts into List 2.\nHit the Stat key then go over to test and select ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ GOF.

All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nThe degrees of freedom in a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ goodness of fit test is $n-1$ where $n$ represents the categories. In this case, the degrees of freedom is $3-1=2$.\n\nOnce you entered the information in press calculate:\n\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2017.
