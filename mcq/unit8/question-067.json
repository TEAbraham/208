  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "A two-sample $T$ procedure should be selected since the data comes from two independent samples.\n\nSince the problem states that the marathon director wishes to estimate the difference, an interval should be used.\n\nA two-sample $T$-test would only give evidence or fail to give evidence of a difference between the two groups, or an increase, but it would not attempt to* measure *the difference.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
