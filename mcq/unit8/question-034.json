The remaining orders will receive no prizes.<br>A group of long-time customers were excited about the new promotion, and over the course of the promotion, they placed $651\\text{ orders}$. Of these orders, $2$ ended up winning $\\$100$, $6$ won $\\$10$, and $52$ won a free soft drink.<br>The group wants to do a chi-squared goodness of fit test to test the advertised odds.<br>Are the conditions met for this test?",

  "solution": "As seen in the counts below, one of the four expected counts is less than $5$ ($3.255$).\n\n\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; see the answer explanations below.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the problem deals with giving prizes away to customers, so there is no reason to doubt randomness.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; the expected counts are calculated below, and all are greater than $1$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; this condition hints at one-proportion $Z$-tests, not chi-squared.",
