A marketing researcher for a major car manufacturer wonders whether the proportions of American-made cars owned by people who live in rural, suburban and urban areas is the same, and decides to do a study.<br>The researcher selects a random sample of individuals who live in each of these settings and asks whether they drive an American-made car or a foreign-made car. Results are shown in the table below.<br>Based upon this data and the results of an appropriate ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test, what should the researcher conclude?",
