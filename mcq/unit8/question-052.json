A marketing researcher for a major car manufacturer wonders whether the proportions of American-made cars owned by people who live in rural, suburban and urban areas is the same, and decides to do a study.<br>The researcher selects a random sample of individuals who live in each of these settings and asks whether they drive an American-made car or a foreign-made car. Results are shown in the table below.<br>Based upon this data and the results of an appropriate ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test, what should the researcher conclude?<br>Based upon this data and the results of an appropriate ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test, what should the researcher conclude?",

  "solution": "A ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test for homogeneity of populations is appropriate here since we have $3$ different populations (rural, suburban, urban) and one variable of interest (type of car).\n\nOur hypotheses would be:\n\n$H_0:$ The proportion of American-made cars and proportion of foreign-made cars is the same for all three populations (rural, suburban and urban).\n\n$H_a:$ Not all of the proportions are the same for all three populations.\n\nFirst, we must check that the conditions for performing this test are satisfied.\n\ni. Our data comes from random sampling of the different populations of interest. It is stated in the problem that this is the case.\n\nii. All expected counts are at least $1$. We need to check this by calculating the expected counts for each cell in our two-way table. We find the expected counts using the formula:\n\n$$EC = \\frac { \\left(\\text{row total} \\right) \\left( \\text{column total} \\right) }{\\text{table total} }$$\n\nFor example, the expected count for American-made cars owned by someone in a rural setting is:\n\n$$EC = \\frac { \\left( 59 \\right) \\left( 85 \\right) }{ 165 } = 30.394$$\n\nShown below are the expected counts for all cells.\n\n\n\nFrom this table, we can see that condition ii is satisfied.\n\niii. No more than $20\\%$ of the expected counts are less than $5$. This can also be verified from the expected counts shown in the table above.\n\nSince we have validated all conditions, now we need to calculate our ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ statistic. The formula is:\n\n$${ \\chi }^{ 2 } = \\sum { \\frac { { \\left( \\text{observed $\n-$ expected} \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ \\text{expected} } }$$\n\nFilling in the formula:\n\n$${ \\chi }^{ 2 } = \\frac { { \\left( 38-30.394 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 30.394 } +\\frac { { \\left( 21-28.606 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 28.606 } +\\frac { { \\left( 25-26.788 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 26.788 } +\\frac { { \\left( 27-25.212 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 25.212 } +\\frac { { \\left( 22-27.818 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 27.818 } +\\frac { { \\left( 32-26.182 \\right) }^{ 2 } }{ 26.182 } = 6.68$$\n\nTo find the $p$-value, we must also know the degrees of freedom. From a $2$-way table, $df = (r – 1)(c – 1)$ where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns.\n\nHere: $r = 3$ and $c = 2$ so $df = (3 – 1)(2 – 1) = 2$.\n\nUsing the $\\chi^2$ table, we can look down the column to find $df = 2$. Look across the row and notice that a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $6.68$ falls between the shown values of $5.99$ and $7.38$. Match these values up with their related probabilities by looking to the top of the column they are in.\n\nA value of $5.99$ matches up with $p = 0.05$ and a value of $7.38$ matches up with $p = 0.025$. Our ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ of $6.38$ would then correspond with a $p$-value somewhere between $0.025$ and $0.05$. We can also find this $p$-value using our TI83/84 graphing calculator and the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$cdf function. The syntax is: ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$cdf(${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value, upper bound, df).\n\nIn this case, you would:\n\nSince $p < 0.05$, we have strong evidence to suggest that the proportions are not the same for all populations and would reject the null hypothesis.\n\nNOTE: for a free-response problem, it is important to show all work. However, on a multiple choice problem of this nature, the entire process could be completed using the TI83/84 graphing calculator.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\nThe calculator gives you the ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ value of $6.68$, $p = 0.035$, and $df = 2$. It has also calculated all of the expected counts for you. They can be found in matrix $B$.\n\nTo see them:\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because it reports inaccurate information about the $p$-value.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This $p$-value results from using the marginal distributions (the totals) in the two-way table as part of the data.\n\nChoice 'C' reports the correct $p$-value, but attaches it to an incorrect conclusion.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Conditions were checked above and found to be satisfied.",
