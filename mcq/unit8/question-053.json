  "question_text": "Young adults in a small town are convinced that age has something to do with whether or not the police will give a driver a ticket when stopped for a traffic violation. The table below summarizes police records from traffic violation stops during the previous year. Driver's Age Ticket Issued Warning Issued Total Under 25 24 18 42 25 - 45 42 37 79 Over 45 15 28 43 Total 81 83 164 Which of the following statements is FALSE?",

      "text": "It appears that whether or not a driver is issued a ticket depends on the driver's age since the age category of under 25 has the highest proportion of tickets issued."

    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "Being under 25 does not appear to be independent of whether a ticket will be issued, because the probability that a driver will be given a ticket if they are under 25 is greater than the overall probability that a driver will be given a ticket."

    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "It appears that whether a driver is given a ticket is dependent on the driver's age, since the probability of getting a ticket and being under 25 does not equal the probability of getting a ticket times the probability of being under 25."

      "letter": "D",
      "text": "It does not appear that being given a ticket is related to being a young driver because more than half of the tickets issued in the previous year were to drivers in the 25-45 age category."
