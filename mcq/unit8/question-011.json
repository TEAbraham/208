  "question_text": "A chemical engineer has been working on developing a new type of candle wax made from coconut oil. The engineer wonders how the amount of time that a candle made of coconut oil wax will burn compared to the time that a candle made of beeswax will burn.<br>After gathering the appropriate data and ensuring that the necessary conditions have been satisfied, which type of significance test should the engineer conduct?",

  "solution": "We have two populations of interest – the population of all candles made from coconut oil wax, and the population of all candles made from beeswax. We want to compare the mean amount of time that candles from each population will burn.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. We cannot combine all candles into a single population. If we did, there would be no way to compare the mean burning times.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. There is no attempt to match the experimental units. In fact, it is the characteristic that distinguishes them (i.e. type of wax) that we hope to be able to gain some insight about. In a matched pairs design, experimental units should be matched in pairs that are as similar to each other as possible.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' are both tests that involve proportions. We are not interested in a proportion. We have two populations of interest – the population of all candles made from coconut oil wax, and the population of all candles made from beeswax. We want to compare the mean amount of time that candles from each population will burn.",
