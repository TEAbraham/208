  "solution": "The number of degrees of freedom can be calculated as $(r -1)(c -1)$ where $r$ is the number of rows and $c$ is the number of columns in the two-way table. Here, we have $4\\text{ rows}$ and $5\\text{ columns}$. Therefore:\n\n$$df = (4 – 1)(5 – 1) = (3)(4) = 12$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because it simply represents the number of rows. Do not take the smaller of $r$ and $c$ when determining degrees of freedom. Also, we cannot find $df$ by subtracting $1$ from the larger of $r$ and $c$.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect and simply represents the number of columns.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. We cannot find the degrees of freedom by multiplying $r$ and $c$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. There were $73{,}661\\text{ observations}$ in the sample, but it is inappropriate to use $n – 1$ degrees of freedom for a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test. Rather, we would use $n – 1$ degrees of freedom when conducting a $t$-test for means.",
