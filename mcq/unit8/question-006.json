  "solution": "The company claims the color distribution to be $45\\%$ Orange, $30\\%$ Brown, and $25\\%$ Yellow. Therefore, if we want to find the expected number of candies for each color, we can take the sample size, $n = 100$, and multiply it by the proportion of colors for each candy. For instance,\n\nExpected Orange: $100(0.45) = 45$\n\nExpected Brown: $100(0.30) = 30$\n\nExpected Yellow: $100(0.25) = 25$\n\nTherefore, the table in Choice $A$ correctly identifies the expected number for each color.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
