  "question_text": "Suppose a well-known candy brand comes in three colors: Orange, Brown, and Yellow. The company that produces the candies claims the color distribution is $45\\%$ Orange, $30\\%$ Brown, and $25\\%$ Yellow. Which table below correctly identifies the expected number of each candy in a sample of $100$ candies?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The company claims the color distribution to be 45 % 45 % Orange, 30 % 30 % Brown, and 25 % 25 % Yellow. Therefore, if we want to find the expected number of candies for each color, we can take the sample size, n = 100 n = 100 , and multiply it by the proportion of colors for each candy. For instance,\n\nExpected Orange: 100 ( 0.45 ) = 45 100 ( 0.45 ) = 45\n\nExpected Brown: 100 ( 0.30 ) = 30 100 ( 0.30 ) = 30\n\nExpected Yellow: 100 ( 0.25 ) = 25 100 ( 0.25 ) = 25\n\nTherefore, the table in Choice A A correctly identifies the expected number for each color.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
