  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "A researcher wants to do a study to see if there is a relationship between how attractive an individual is perceived as being and their annual income level. He has randomly selected a sample of individuals who all agree to participate in his study.\nTo rate attractiveness, he will show each individual's picture to a separate large sample of people and will combine their responses in order to classify each individual as being of high, average or low attractiveness. He will then match that up with each individual's annual income level using the following categories: Under $50,000, Between $50,000 and $100,000, Over $100,000.\nIn order to analyze his results he has decided to use a ${ \\chi }^{ 2 }$ test. What should his hypotheses be?",
