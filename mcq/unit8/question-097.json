  "question_text": "A car rental company is conducting a study regarding the types of car preferred by customers at the company’s various locations. The table below summarizes the reservations over a seven-day period at three of the company’s locations.<br>The company is willing to consider the $244$ reservations at Location $1$ as a random sample from the set of all reservations at Location $1$, the $267$ reservations at Location $2$ as a random sample from the set of all reservations at Location $2$, and the $279$ reservations at Location $3$ as a random sample from the set of all reservations at Location $3$.<br>If a significance level of $0.05$ is used, does these data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the distributions of the car types between the populations of reservations at the three locations?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn a chi-square test for association or independence, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference in the proportions of car types rented at each of the locations. Under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true, the $P$-value gives the probability of obtaining a $\\chi^2$ test statistic value as extreme as or more extreme than the one found in this study.\n\nIf given a significance level, like in this case $0.05$, comparing the $P$-value to the significance level determines if the results of the study are significant enough to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n\nThe $P$-value of a chi-square test is found by calculating the area to the right of the chi-square test statistic. This can be done using several calculator functions and commands.\n\nWhen analyzing the results given in a two-way table, the matrix function can be used to input the data into the calculator. Next, the $\\chi^2$ Test is done, resulting in a $\\chi^2$ test statistic of $12.407$ and a $P$-value of $0.0535$.\n\nThus, comparing the $P$-value of $0.0535$ to the significance level of $0.05$, the $P$-value is larger so the results of this study are not statistically significant and the null hypothesis cannot be rejected in favor of the alternative.\n\nSo, Choice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect: The $P$-value of $0.0535$ is not less than $0.01$.\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect: The $P$-value of $0.0535$ is not less than the significance level of $0.05$.\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect: Results of a study are statistically significant if the $P$-value is less than the significance level. The $P$-value of $0.0535$ is not less than the significance level of $0.05$ so the results are not statistically significant.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect: The $P$-value is compared to the significance level (in this problem, $0.05$). If the complement of the significance level is found, the confidence level for a confidence interval is calculated (in this problem, $0.95$). The $P$-value is not compared to the confidence level, C.",
