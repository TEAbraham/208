  "question_text": "A car rental company is conducting a study regarding the types of car preferred by customers at the company’s various locations. The table below summarizes the reservations over a seven-day period at three of the company’s locations.<br>The company is willing to consider the $244$ reservations at Location $1$ as a random sample from the set of all reservations at Location $1$, the $267$ reservations at Location $2$ as a random sample from the set of all reservations at Location $2$, and the $279$ reservations at Location $3$ as a random sample from the set of all reservations at Location $3$.<br>If a significance level of $0.05$ is used, does these data provide sufficient evidence to indicate a difference in the distributions of the car types between the populations of reservations at the three locations?",
