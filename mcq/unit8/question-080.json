  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Since there are $4$ different samples representing $4$ populations, a chi-squared test for homogeneity should be used. The null hypothesis for such a test is that the different populations are homogeneous. The alternative is that the different populations studied are NOT homogeneous.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'A' and B are incorrect; when dealing with several samples, each representing a different population, a chi-squared test for homogeneity, not association, is used. A chi-squared test for association is used when there is only one sample concerning two factors.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the hypotheses are switched here. The null hypothesis will always be that the samples are homogenous.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; chi-squared tests can never have a two-sided alternative.",
