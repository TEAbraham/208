Fans of the southsiders were overjoyed when their White Mittens won the 2005 World Championship, while fans of the \"lovable losers\" have been waiting a very long time for their Northside Chicago Calves to win a World Series. But which team really has more fans in the city of Chicago? Researchers decided to do a study. To gather data, they randomly called phone numbers with $312$, $773$ or $872$ area codes (the current three Chicago area codes), and asked which of the two teams the person answering the phone preferred.<br>Which of the following best describes the manner in which data was collected?",
