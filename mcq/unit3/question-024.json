Fans of the southsiders were overjoyed when their White Mittens won the 2005 World Championship, while fans of the \"lovâ€‹able losers\" have been waiting a very long time for their Northside Chicago Calves to win a World Series. But which team really has more fans in the city of Chicago? Researchers decided to do a study. To gather data, they randomly called phone numbers with <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$312$</span>, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$773$</span> or <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$872$</span> area codes (the current three Chicago area codes), and asked which of the two teams the person answering the phone preferred.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of the following best describes the manner in which data was collected?</div>",
