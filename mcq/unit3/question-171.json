  "solution": "Any number of common response or confounding lurking variables could be at play here, such as discipline or socio-economic status.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; while exercise may not have a causal link to crime, there could be (and appears there is) an association.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; since this was not an experiment, one cannot prove a causal link.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; this is an observational study, not an experiment.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; this is an observational study, and while linkage may be made in an observational study, causal linkage may not.",
