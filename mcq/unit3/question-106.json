  "solution": "A survey is a good way to gather data related to opinions and behaviors.\n\nHowever, students would not accurately be able to report whether or not reading a text in a color other than black would enable them to remember more of the information that they have read. The best way to investigate this question would be by way of a well-designed and properly conducted experiment.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. It would be appropriate to gather data related to guest's opinions of the hotel by way of a survey.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. A survey could be used to measure teenagers behavior related to how often they go out to the movies.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. A survey would be an appropriate way to gather data that measures behavior with respect to eating breakfast.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect since it would be inappropriate to use a survey for the purposes described in Choice 'B'.",
