  "question_text": "No one likes a cake that collapses on itself after it comes out of the oven! To find the best way to prevent falling cakes, a baker runs an experiment using $24\\text{ cakes}$:<br>Group A: $12\\text{ cakes}$ are made with $1\\text{ teaspoon}$ of baking powder and bake at $350\\text{ degrees}$ for $35\\text{ minutes}$.<br>Group B: $12\\text{ cakes}$ are made with $1.5\\text{ teaspoons}$ of baking powder and bake at $375\\text{ degrees}$ for $30\\text{ minutes}$.<br>Ten minutes after the cakes come out of the oven, an assistant measures the height of each cake at its center. The assistant does not know the specific treatment given to any of the cakes he measures. The average height of the cakes in Group B is significantly higher than the average height of the cakes in Group A.<br>This study is flawed because it demonstrates",

  "solution": "Confounding happens when there is more than one variable that could have caused the observed effect in an experiment.\n\nIn this case, the baker does not know if the Group B cakes maintained their height because they had more baking powder or because they were baked at a higher temperature.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Response bias refers to something that might inappropriately influence a respondent's answers. The subjects of this experiment are not humans.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. It is true that there is blinding in this experiment because the assistant does not know which treatments the cakes received. This is a good design feature, not a flaw.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The placebo effect describes the human tendency to perceive an improvement when any treatment is imposed, even an ineffective treatment such as a sugar pill. This is not an issue here because the subjects are cakes, not humans.\n\nGiven that Choice 'B' is correct and identified a flaw, Choice 'E' is incorrect.",
