  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe three essential parts of an experiment are randomness, replication, and control.\n\nSo, Choice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect: Randomness is the most important element of any experiment but replication and control are also vital elements.\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect: Randomness and replication are important elements of a well-designed experiment but without control, comparisons are difficult or impossible to make.\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect: Randomness and control are important elements of a well-designed experiment but without replication, trends are difficult to determine. Researchers need to be able to determine if the results of the experiment are due to chance or due to a causal relationship.\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect: Replication and control are important elements of a well-designed experiment but without randomness, bias is very likely to occur.",
