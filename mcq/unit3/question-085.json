Suppose a random sample of $100\\text{ smokers}$ averages $196.4\\text{ lbs}$ with a standard deviation of $6.5\\text{ lbs}$ , and a random sample of $100\\text{ non-smokers}$ averages $174.5\\text{ lbs}$ with a standard deviation of $4.6\\text{ lbs}$ . What conclusions could be drawn when comparing smokers to non-smokers?",
