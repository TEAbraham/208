  "solution": "A census refers to the study of an entire population. In this case, we are looking for where would it be most difficult to study an entire population.\n\nChoice 'D' is our answer because finding the total number of sharks in all the oceans would be near impossible. The population of sharks would also be constantly changing due to death and reproduction.\n\nChoices 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'E' are all not the most likely because the populations are smaller and the area being covered is smaller compared to finding the sharks in the oceans.",
