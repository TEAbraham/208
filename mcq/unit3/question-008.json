  "question_text": "A teaching assistant is in charge of grading the exams given in their college class. The professor wants a general idea of how the students are doing in his course so he asks the assistant to give him a small sample of the scores while grading. The assistant selects the first $10$ exams from the pile (organized by who turned in the exam first) and grades them and sends the average to the professor.<br>Will the sample the assistant provided give the professor the best idea of how his students are doing?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe professor has asked the teaching assistant to collect data to create a sample of scores to show how the students are learning. The teaching assistant selects a sample of 10 students, but selects the first 10 tests that are turned in.\n\nThe issue lies that the test are not selected using a chance process. In fact, we know that data collected by not using a chance process is untrustworthy. Therefore, the data the professor received from the assistant is not to be trusted as it was not selected using a chance process.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Although 10\ncould be an acceptable sample size, it was not selected with a chance process.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The assistant's sample does in fact come from the students in the class, but as noted above, it is untrustworthy because it was not selected with a chance process.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. The assistant's average will more than likely be different from the class average because the people who turn the test in first will more than likely be different than those who turned it in later.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. 10\ncould a large enough sample if the sample is selected with a chance process.",
