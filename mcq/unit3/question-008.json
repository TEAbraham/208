The professor wants a general idea of how the students are doing in his course so he asks the assistant to give him a small sample of the scores while grading. The assistant selects the first <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10$</span> exams from the pile (organized by who turned in the exam first) and grades them and sends the average to the professor. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Will the sample the assistant provided give the professor the best idea of how his students are doing?</div>",
