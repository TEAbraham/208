  "question_text": "Absorbs-All is a paper towel company that claims its paper towels can absorb $25\\%$ more liquid than the leading paper towel. At the end of each day, quality control inspectors at the manufacturing plant collect a sample of all the paper towels produced that day to ensure the absorbing standard is being met.<br>Which of the following describes the best way for quality control officers to collect the sample?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "One of the main characteristics of a well-designed survey is random selection of the subjects. Random selection helps to avoid bias in the statistics that are calculated from the sample.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nThe incorrect answer choices all describe selection methods that sound convenient, but none of them include randomness. They would all lead to a biased estimate of the absorbency of the paper towels.\n\nChoices 'A' and 'B' are incorrect. This introduces a bias that is not representative of production throughout the day. There may be a learning curve or difference in those made earlier than later in the day.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This represents blatant bias based on appearance. By selecting the most typical looking rolls, the inspector is not looking at a representative sample.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This represents undercoverage by not looking at the other assembly lines.",
