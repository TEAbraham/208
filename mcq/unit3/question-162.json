  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "A sampling method is a simple random sample only if every possible subgroup has the same chance of being chosen.\n\nChoices 'B' and 'D' are incorrect because the bouncy balls were sorted on a characteristic (color/swirled or production line) first. This is a feature of a stratified random sample. It is not a simple random sample because a subgroup of all swirly bouncy balls has no chance of being chosen.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because the inspector is using every 50th bouncy ball\nthat comes off the line. This is called a systematic random sample. It is not a simple random sample because every possible subgroup does not have the same chance to be chosen.",
