  "question_text": "In order to test the effectiveness of two fertilizers, Grow Fertilizer and Fertilizer Plus, a farmer designs the following two experiments:<br>Experiment A: The farmer will first divide his land into $10$ equal sections. For each section, the farmer flips a coin; if the coin lands on tails, Grow Fertilizer will be used on the East side of the section, and if the coin lands on heads, Fertilizer Plus will be used on the East side of the section. Whichever fertilizer is not used on the East side of the section will be used on the West side. This process will be repeated for each of the remaining nine sections. After $4$ weeks, the farmer will observe which side of each section produced more crops.<br>Experiment B: The farmer will first divide his land into $10$ equal sections (the $5$ sections on the East side of his land and the $5$ sections on the West side of his land). A coin will be flipped once to determine which of the two fertilizers is used on the East side of his land. If the coin lands on tails, Grow Fertilizer will be used; if the coin lands on heads, Fertilizer Plus will be used. Whichever Fertilizer is not used on the $5$ sections on the East side of his land will be used on the five sections on the West side of his land. After $4$ weeks, the farmer will observe which side of his land (East or West) produced more crops.<br>Which of the following statements is not true?",
