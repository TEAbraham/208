  "solution": "The sample was made of only women in the U.S. between the ages of 40 and 60. Since samples are chosen to represent the population, the population of interest must also have these characteristics.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This is inclusive of males and females, while the sample was only taken of females.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This is inclusive of all ages of American females.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' are incorrect. While the underlying motive of the study may be to study doctors, the survey itself is interested in the opinions of women aged 40 to 60.",
