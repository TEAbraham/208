She samples each container of beads she receives from the manufacturer to make sure the bead size is consistent with what she ordered.<br>Which of the following is the most important for Lisa to include in her sampling in order to ensure that the sample is representative of all of the beads in the container?<br>Which of the following is the most important for Lisa to include in her sampling in order to ensure that the sample is representative of all of the beads in the container?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Choice 'D' is correct because random selection helps to ensure that a sample is representative of its population. In other words, random selection helps to prevent bias (systematically overestimating or underestimating the bead size).\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'A' and 'B' are also features of good sampling, but they do not help ensure that a sample is representative of the population.\n\nChoice 'C' describes convenience sampling which is a biased sampling method.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because a large, poorly selected sample would still not be representative of the population of beads.",
