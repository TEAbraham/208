  "question_text": "A company that produces pacifiers for babies is conducting an experiment to see which prototype of pacifier babies prefer. The company recruits $100$ babies between the age of $3$ and $9$ months that use pacifiers. Of the $100$ babies, $50$ babies are assigned to use pacifier $A$, while the remaining $50$ babies are assigned pacifier $B$. The company measures the length of use and overall enjoyment of the pacifier.<br>What are the experiment units of this experiment?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn an experiment, different conditions, called treatments, are assigned to experimental units, or subjects. In the pacifier experiment, the treatments that were assigned would be the two different types of pacifiers.\n\nWhile the treatments are the pacifiers, the experimental units are the $100$ babies that are recruited for the experiment. The experimental units are then split into two groups, one assigned to pacifier $A$ and the other assigned to pacifier $B$. Therefore, the experimental units are the $100$ babies.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. The pacifiers themselves would be considered the treatments for the experiments.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The group of 50\nbabies that use pacifier A\nare a subgroup of the sample that was assigned to treatment A\n.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. The group of 50\nbabies that use pacifier B\nare a subgroup of the sample that was assigned to treatment B\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since the sample of 100\ncame from all babies that use pacifiers, this represents the population.",
