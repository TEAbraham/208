  "question_text": "A company that produces pacifiers for babies is conducting an experiment to see which prototype of pacifier babies prefer. The company recruits $100$ babies between the age of $3$ and $9$ months that use pacifiers. Of the $100$ babies, $50$ babies are assigned to use pacifier $A$, while the remaining $50$ babies are assigned pacifier $B$. The company measures the length of use and overall enjoyment of the pacifier.<br>What are the experiment units of this experiment?",

  "solution": "In an experiment, different conditions, called treatments, are assigned to experimental units, or subjects. In the pacifier experiment, the treatments that were assigned would be the two different types of pacifiers.\n\nWhile the treatments are the pacifiers, the experimental units are the 100\nbabies that are recruited for the experiment. The experimental units are then split into two groups, one assigned to pacifier A\nand the other assigned to pacifier B\n. Therefore, the experimental units are the 100\nbabies.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
