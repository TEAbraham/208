  "question_text": "A bubble gum company would like to predict how well its new cucumber flavored bubble gum will sell. The company takes a sample by sending a team of surveyors to a randomly chosen veggie juice bar for a day. As the $72\\text{ customers}$ of the day leave the juice bar, the surveyors give them a sample of the cucumber bubble gum and ask them if they like it enough to pay $\\$3.00$ for a pack of $5\\text{ pieces}$.<br>The bubble gum is unwrapped so the subjects can't tell which brand of bubble gum they are tasting. At the end of the day, the surveyors will use the responses from the sample to estimate the proportion of all customers who would answer 'Yes'.<br>What is the main flaw in this sampling method?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Because these subjects are patrons of a veggie juice bar, they probably like the flavors of most vegetables.\n\nThis makes them more likely to enjoy cucumber flavored bubble gum.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. A sample size of 72\nis often large enough to satisfy the n\nˆ\np\n>10\nand n\nˆ\nq\n>10\ncondition for proportions.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. There is no response bias - it is good that the subjects are not being influenced by the brand of the bubble gum.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. For such a short survey as this, it is unlikely that a lack of payment will cause a large number of non-responders.",
