The company takes a sample by sending a team of surveyors to a randomly chosen veggie juice bar for a day.  As the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$72\\text{ customers}$</span> of the day leave the juice bar, the surveyors give them a sample of the cucumber bubble gum and ask them if they like it enough to pay <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\$3.00$</span> for a pack of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5\\text{ pieces}$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">The bubble gum is unwrapped so the subjects can't tell which brand of bubble gum they are tasting.  At the end of the day, the surveyors will use the responses from the sample to estimate the proportion of all customers who would answer 'Yes'.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What is the main flaw in this sampling method?</div>",
