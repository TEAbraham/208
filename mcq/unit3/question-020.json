Which statement is false regarding the situation?",

  "solution": "The headline is interpreting the results of a study from 30 30 volunteer participants. The participants in the study also consistently ran 10 10 miles a day. This fact leads you to the belief that since the participants were already running 10 10 miles per day, we cannot generalize the results to the whole population.\n\nAdditionally, the study is an observational study as there was no treatment imposed on the individuals in the study. Therefore, we cannot show a cause and effect relationship between running 10 10 miles per day and the lowering of blood pressure. We would need a well-designed experiment to show a causal relationship.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
