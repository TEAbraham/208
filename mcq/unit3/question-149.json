  "question_text": "Suppose $100$ volunteers were selected for a study over a $6$ -month period. Of these, $50$ randomly chosen subjects were given a weight loss drug. These $50\\text{ subjects}$ had an average weight loss of $11.6\\text{ lbs}$ with a standard deviation of $4.2\\text{ pounds}$ . The remaining $50\\text{ subjects}$ lost an average of $12.2\\text{ lbs}$ with a standard deviation of $4.1\\text{ lbs}$ on a placebo. What could one conclude about the weight loss drugs’ effectiveness?",
