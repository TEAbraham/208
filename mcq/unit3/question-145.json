  "question_text": "Suppose a teacher wishes to determine if his students learn better through in-class instruction or computer program.\nThe teacher has only $10\\text{ students}$, so he randomly divides them into two groups of $5$, one group of which learns through in-class instruction while the other group learns via computer program.\nWhy could the results be better trusted if the experiment were done in a matched pairs fashion?",

      "text": "Even if the subjects were randomly divided, such a small sample size makes it very likely that one group could have more intelligent students than the other simply by chance."
