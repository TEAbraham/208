  "question_text": "A school is pondering starting the school day earlier. The assistant principal comes up with a survey to ask students if they support the change to an earlier time. She then waits at the school entrance and asks the first $30$ students who show up to school. Should the school trust the results of the survey?",

      "text": "No, because the first students to the school will not be affected by an earlier start time."

      "letter": "B",
      "text": "No, because the assistant principal did a survey and not an experiment."

    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Yes, because she asked a sample of students."

    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "Yes, because she asked 30 30 students."

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The assistant principal is collecting data regarding the new school start time. She asks 30 30 students their thoughts on the new schedule for a survey.\n\nThe issue that the assistant principal has is that she asks the first 30 30 students. This does not represent a random sample, and given that variation may or may not be random, the conclusions are uncertain. These students would be the most likely to not be affected by a schedule change.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
