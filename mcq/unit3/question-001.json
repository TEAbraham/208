  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe assistant principal is collecting data regarding the new school start time. She asks $30$ students their thoughts on the new schedule for a survey.\n\nThe issue that the assistant principal has is that she asks the first $30$ students. This does not represent a random sample, and given that variation may or may not be random, the conclusions are uncertain. These students would be the most likely to not be affected by a schedule change.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The assistant principal can do a survey to accumulate the responses, but the sample must be random.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Although the assistant principal did ask students, she did not ask a random sample of students.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Even though she asked 30 students, the students she selected needed to be a random sample to make a conclusion based on the data.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. In fact, as stated above, the sample must be random in order to make a conclusion about the data.",
