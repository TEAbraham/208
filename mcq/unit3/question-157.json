To test the new drug, researchers identify <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$45\\text{ subjects}$</span> who suffer from frequent headaches.  The subjects are randomly assigned to take one of three treatments when they experience their next headache:  the new medication, a currently available medication, or a sugar pill.  All pills are manufactured to look identical to each other.  The subjects will record the amount of time it takes to experience pain relief.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of the following statements is true?</div><blockquote><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>I.</strong>  Some subjects might perceive quicker pain relief simply because they've taken a pill (either active medication or sugar pill).  Researchers control for this placebo effect by giving all subjects a pill.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>II.</strong>  The sugar pills are a part of the blinding in this experiment.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>III.</strong>  The researchers use the sugar pills in order to determine the effects of sugar on pain relief.    </div></blockquote>",
