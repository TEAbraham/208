  "question_text": "The Director of Activities at a local museum is introducing a new film series detailing the events of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Jr. To see if there is local interest, the Director mails a survey to a random sample of $100$ residents who live in the cities near the museum.<br>Seventy-five responses are received and $70$% of the responses express much interest in the new film series. These results encourage the Director of Activities to launch a large advertising campaign for the new film series boasting strong local support.<br>Bias is present in the design of this study. Which of the following best describes the bias?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice ‘D’ is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nBias is present when certain outcomes are systematically favored more than others. This prompt is an example of response bias.\n\nIn this case, the Director should be cautious about advertising these results as the opinions of all people, as those who responded did so voluntarily and most likely have strong opinions and/or more interest in the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Jr, than would the average person. In general, when a voluntary response sample is taken, the results usually overestimate or underestimate a value being recorded.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect: This statement could be correct but is not a source of bias.\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect: The percent of a sample who respond could have an effect on the results of a survey but is not a source of bias.\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect: Small samples can be problematic when generalizing the results of a sample to a population. Here, however, the sample of $100$ is not small. Additionally, small samples are not sources of bias.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect: This statement could also be true. Different samples of residents are likely to include different people, resulting in different opinions; this is a concept known as sampling variability. In fact, when multiple samples taken from a population result in similar opinions, a researcher can be confident in generalizing the results to the population the samples are taken from. However, this is not a source of bias.",
