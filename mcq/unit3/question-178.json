  "question_text": "In a recent study, $50$ student-athletes from Knoxville State University were randomly selected to complete a survey. One of the goals of the study was to estimate the percent of athletes who stretch prior to exercising. $36$ of the $50$ athletes said they stretch prior to exercising.\nWhich of the following gives the best explanation for why these results cannot be used as an estimate of all student-athletes in the United States who stretch prior to exercising?<br>Which of the following gives the best explanation for why these results cannot be used as an estimate of all student-athletes in the United States who stretch prior to exercising?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice ‘A’ is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nIt is only appropriate to generalize about a population based on samples that are randomly selected from that population.\n\nIn this case, only student-athletes at Knoxville State University were chosen to participate in the survey, so these results can only be generalized to student-athletes at Knoxville State University.\n\nSo, Choice ‘A’ is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect: Only student-athletes at Knoxville State University were chosen to participate in the survey, so these results can only be generalized to student-athletes at Knoxville State University. This cannot be generalized to also include student-athletes around the Knoxville State University campus, as they were not part of the original sample.\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect: Only student-athletes at Knoxville State University were chosen to participate in the survey, so these results can only be generalized to student-athletes at Knoxville State University. This cannot be generalized to also include all students of Knoxville State University campus, as they were not part of the original sample.\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect: Usually, a sample of size $50$ is a large enough sample to accurately represent the population, although the population size can sometimes be very large that a larger sample would be needed.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect: While this statement could be true, it does not give the best justification to be deemed correct.",
