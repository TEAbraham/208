  "question_text": "In a recent study, $50$ student-athletes from Knoxville State University were randomly selected to complete a survey. One of the goals of the study was to estimate the percent of athletes who stretch prior to exercising. $36$ of the $50$ athletes said they stretch prior to exercising. Which of the following gives the best explanation for why these results cannot be used as an estimate of all student-athletes in the United States who stretch prior to exercising?",
