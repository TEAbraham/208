  "solution": "This question addresses the main types of bias. Students need to know all types of bias that may exist in polls and be able to identify these biases in the context of a problem.\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the wording is straightforward.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the intentions of the pollster are unaffected by constituents’ depth of knowledge of their representative.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; this is NOT a stratified sample.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct; this problem in particular clearly has undercoverage of the homeless and unlisted.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; the intentions of the pollster are unaffected by voter eligibility.",
