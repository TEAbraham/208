  "solution": "When no treatment is imposed, and one is simply observing behaviors, it is an observational study.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'A', 'B', and 'E' are incorrect; each of these selections implies an experiment; however, even though males and females are separated, this is not an experiment since we are not imposing any treatment.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; for it to be a census, the entire population would have to be polled. This is not the case in this situation.",
