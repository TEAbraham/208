  "question_text": "A professor wanted to know whether a prep course would increase students’ test scores.<br>Twelve subjects were randomly chosen to take the prep course, and they scored an average of $20.3$ with a standard deviation of $8.3\\text{ points}$. Another $12\\text{ subjects}$ were randomly chosen who were not allowed to take the test prep course, and they scored an average of $18.3$ with a standard deviation of $9.1\\text{ points}$.<br>Despite these scores, why might the professor not be convinced that the course helps?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "With such large standard deviations, the differences of 2 points\ncould have easily happened by chance. A statistical test could prove this, but by glancing at the standard deviations, it should be obvious without doing any calculations.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'",
