Twelve subjects were randomly chosen to take the prep course, and they scored an average of $20.3$ with a standard deviation of $8.3\\text{ points}$ . Another $12\\text{ subjects}$ were randomly chosen who were not allowed to take the test prep course, and they scored an average of $18.3$ with a standard deviation of $9.1\\text{ points}$ .
