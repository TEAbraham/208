He posts this video to all his social media accounts. Can we say with certainty that $99.07\\%$ of golfers who watch the video fix their swing?",

  "solution": "The golf coach is using data collection to present his findings to help promote his video. He is claiming that there is a 99.07 % 99.07 % success rate after watching the video.\n\nThe issue with this claim is that not all golfers who watch the video will answer a survey regarding whether or not the video helped. Many golfers will quickly watch the video and move on with their life.  He will mainly only get responses from the people in which the video helped. We have no way of knowing if the video helped the golfers who did not respond.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
