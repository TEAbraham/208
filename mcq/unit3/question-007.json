  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe author used a survey to collect data. The poll collects data regarding her new novel on a social media site that requires her fans to follow her.\n\nSince people on the social media site have to follow her, only those who choose to follow her see her social media posts. Therefore, we cannot apply the results to all people or all fans. We can only apply the results to those who follow her on the social media site and directly responded to the survey. We cannot say for certain that people who don't follow her on social media sites feel the same way, nor can we say that the results are representative of all her social media followers since only those who care enough to respond take the time to do so.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice' A' is incorrect. Not all novel readers follow her social media page, so we cannot apply the results to them.\n\nChoice' B' is incorrect. Even though those who do follow her are fans, not all fans follow her social media site posts.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Not all followers may have seen or chosen to participate in the poll.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since the poll was only given to her social media followers, we can not be certain that all people feel the same way.",
