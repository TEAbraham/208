  "solution": "The author used a survey to collect data . The poll collects data regarding her new novel on a social media site that requires her fans to follow her.\n\nSince people on the social media site have to follow her, only those who choose to follow her see her social media posts. Therefore, we cannot apply the results to all people or all fans. We can only apply the results to those who follow her on the social media site and directly responded to the survey. We cannot say for certain that people who don't follow her on social media sites feel the same way, nor can we say that the results are representative of all her social media followers since only those who care enough to respond take the time to do so.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
