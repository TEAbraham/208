A group of doctors wants to determine whether a small increase in Vitamin B<span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$12$</span> will help their anemic patients to feel a bit more energetic and strong.  The doctors obtain a group of volunteers with anemia and randomly assign them to two groups.  Prior to the study, all patients were ingesting a standard amount of Vitamin B<span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$12$</span> and so the doctors decide to keep that amount constant for one group and to increase the amount by <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> micrograms (mcg) for the other group.  The doctors monitor the health of the volunteers for the duration of the study.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of these statements is <strong>NOT</strong> true about this study?</div>",
