  "question_text": "Suppose the superintendent of a large school district is interested in district-wide student satisfaction with the cafeteria food.<br>The superintendent decides to conduct a stratified sample by randomly selecting $30\\text{ subjects}$ from each grade level, K-12, for a total of $390\\text{ students}$ surveyed in the district.<br>What is the greatest benefit of conducting a stratified sample such as this one, compared to a simple random sample of $390\\text{ students}$?",

      "text": "Students are less likely to lie about their feelings regarding cafeteria food in this district if the sample is stratified."

      "letter": "E",
      "text": "In this situation, there are no benefits of a stratified sample compared to a simple random sample."
    }
  ],
  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "By using a stratified sample, the superintendent will be able to see food satisfaction of all ages of students in the district. It is possible that different ages have different feelings in regard to food satisfaction, and stratifying controls for these differences.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
