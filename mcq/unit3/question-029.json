  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A'is incorrect; in most situations, the sample is much smaller than the population, and if the sample is perfectly random, a sample size of 1,000âˆ’2,000 subjects is usually large enough.",
  "solution": "Choice 'B' is correct; this is the basic definition of sampling.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; while simple random samples give good results, other types of samples such as multistage or stratified also work well in certain situations.\n\nChoice 'D\" is incorrect; this describes a census.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; this describes a convenience sample, which typically contains high amounts of bias.",
