  "question_text": "A state Wildlife and Fisheries agent is trying to stimulate the growth of the population of a certain type of fish. She will conduct an experiment that involves randomly assigning $3\\text{ different treatments}$ to $36\\text{ fish}$ to determine which treatment will cause the largest amount of weight gain in the fish. The agent wants to make sure that the $3\\text{ treatment groups}$ each have exactly $12\\text{ fish}$.\nWhich of the following methods should be used to assign the treatments?",
