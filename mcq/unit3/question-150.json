  "title": "Potassium Water Study | 1 of 2",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "Would drinking potassium water during a workout on the treadmill help you to reach a higher average speed during your workout than drinking regular bottled water? A sports doctor decided to do a study and twenty volunteers who typically work out on a treadmill agreed to participate.<br>Each volunteer was asked to walk on the treadmill for $30$ minutes on two separate occasions with a one week break in between. During one of the two workouts, the participant was given a bottle of regular water to drink and during the other workout they were given a bottle of potassium water which looks and tastes just like regular water.<br>The type of water received first was determined at random. While participants were unable to see their speed on the treadmill during their workouts, the average speed for both workouts was recorded and the difference between the two mean speeds was determined for each individual.<br>How could this study incorporate double blinding?",
