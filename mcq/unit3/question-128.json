The $26\\text{ tennis players}$ will be randomly assigned to two groups - one group's rackets will get nylon strings and the other group's rackets will get polyester strings.<br>Each player will serve a tennis ball $35\\text{ times}$. For each player, the coach will record the proportion of serves that land in the service box and the average speed of the serves.<br>Which of the following statements is FALSE?",
