  "question_text": "Mamma Mia wonders whether her toddler Tony will eat more pizza flavored crackers when watching television or when eating his snack at the table without any distractions. To test her suspicions, she feeds him pizza flavored crackers at snack time on several different occasions.\nEach time she gives him the crackers, she randomly determines whether or not she will allow him to watch television as he eats. Mamma always counts how many crackers Tony consumes at snack time, so that she can compare the overall average number of crackers consumed with and without watching television.\nWhich of the following best describes Mamma's method of gathering data?",
