  "difficulty": "Moderate",
  "question_text": "For runners and other athletes, the right type of socks can make the difference between comfort and painful blisters! We Are Socks sells wicking socks that draw moisture away from the skin and help to prevent blisters.  Unfortunately, the socks become thinner and often develop holes after a relatively short period of time.  Many customers have been complaining. Chemical engineers at We Are Socks have developed a new chemical compound.  They believe that when this chemical compound is applied to the socks during the manufacturing process it will strengthen the fibers and help to create a wicking sock that is less prone to thinning and developing holes.  The compound does not change the appearance or feel of the socks, so those who wear the new socks would not be able to tell the difference between socks treated with the new compound and those not treated with the compound. Which of the following would be the best way to gather data in order to establish whether or not the new chemical compound helps socks to stay stronger, thicker, and hole-free for a longer period of time?",
