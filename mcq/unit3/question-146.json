  "solution": "This situation controls for the variables that the other answer options do not, as detailed below.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; this selection does not control for intelligence; simply by chance, some individuals might be more intelligent than others.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; people who choose to sign up for the course are most likely more motivated; signing up for the course should not be voluntary when evaluating the courseâ€™s effectiveness.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; students could easily increase their ACT score the second time regardless of the prep course.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; pairing by age does not make sense; however, the pairing system could work if the students were paired up in terms of similar ACT score before the class.",
