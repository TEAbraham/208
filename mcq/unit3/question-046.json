  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When conducting a survey, it is important that the sample accurately represent the population of interest - in this case, members of the cruise line's loyalty program.\n\nBy attempting to contact every individual enrolled in the program, by email or by regular mail, the cruise line can most accurately gather the opinions of all members of the loyalty program regardless of when they cruise, from which home ports, and to which destinations.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This choice makes use of a cluster sample and does limit the sample to individuals from the population of interest. However, the month of the sailing could be a confounding variable. For example, if the month selected was during the summer, then the survey may be more likely to reach loyalty program members who are traveling with children while on summer vacation. The results may not accurately represent the population of all members of the loyalty program.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This choice makes use of a stratified random sample. However, it does not limit the final sample to individuals who are part of the population of interest - those in the loyalty program. By randomly choosing individuals from the selected sailings, they may in fact be choosing individuals who are not part of the loyalty program.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. While it appears that this method is atempting to conduct a census (for one month), by providing the survey to \"every individual\", this method does not limit the sample to those who are part of the population of interest. Therefore, the results of the survey cannot accurately be applied to members of the loyalty program. Additionally, the use of responses for only one month may confound the results of the survey as described above.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This choice makes use of a voluntary response sample in which the survey is made widely available but individuals must choose themselves to become part of the sample by filling out and returning the survey. Individuals who participate in voluntary response samples are likely to have strong opinions on certain issues and these opinions may not accurately represent the population of interest. Additionally, as described, this method of collecting data does not appear to limit the responses to those who are part of the loyalty program.",
