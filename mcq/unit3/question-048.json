  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When picking a variable to stratify on for this situation, the superintendent must think which variable will most easily create homogenous groups in regards to feelings about the cafeteria food.\n\nThe variables favorite color, last name, height, and favorite sport most likely will not have any associations with feelings on the quality of cafeteria food. However, it's certainly plausible that people with different favorite foods have different feelings about the quality of cafeteria food, so that would be an appropriate variable for stratification.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
