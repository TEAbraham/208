  "solution": "Although we may eventually collect data from those who are selected to be in our sample, the sample must be selected first. Stratified random sampling is a method of designing our sample.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Once a sample has been gathered, data can actually be collected from the sample by way of observational study.\n\nChoices 'B' and 'C' are incorrect. Matched Pairs and Completely Randomized Design are two specific methods that can be used to design experiments. From these experiments, we will be able to collect data.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. A survey is a specific instrument that is used as part of an observational study or experiment. The answers to a survey provide us with data.",
