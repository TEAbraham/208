The researchers decide to use a block design and wish to test the difference between the new drug and a more traditional treatment.<br>What would be an effective variable to block on?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Blocking reduces variability within a treatment by forming blocks of subjects that are as similar as possible on the treatment.\n\nIn this situation, advancement phase of cancer will have a much larger effect on the treatment of cancer than last name or location of the patients, rendering Choices 'B'and 'E' incorrect.\n\nChoices 'A' and 'D' are incorrect as the problem already states there are 200 males and all already have prostate cancer.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
