  "question_text": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is an extremely rare degenerative brain disorder that is usually fatal within a year of the onset of symptoms. There is no cure and treatment is generally aimed at alleviating symptoms.\nSuppose a new medication has been developed which shows some promise of alleviating symptoms while also slowing the progression of the disease and extending the lives of individuals who are affected.\nIf $30$ individuals who have recently been diagnosed with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease have agreed to take part in a study to evaluate whether the new medication will alleviate symptoms and help those with the disease live longer lives, which of the following outlines how best to conduct the study?",
