  "solution": "The data clearly has non-response bias, as only $403\\text{ students}$ responded out of the $1{,}300$ total, meaning $897\\text{ students}$ did not respond.\n\nNon-response is a potential problem in every sample because the group of students who chose to respond to the poll may have different political views than the students who chose not to respond. Jeff did not get a random sample.",
