  "question_text": "Researchers are curious if there is a connection between childhood cancer rates and living near power lines.<br>What could be a viable way to investigate this relationship?<br>I. Randomly select $200\\text{ children}$ and move half of them near power lines while ensuring the other half do not live near power lines then compare cancer rates.<br>II. Randomly select $100\\text{ children}$ who live near power lines and another $100\\text{ children}$ who do not live near power lines then investigate cancer rates of the respective groups.<br>III. Randomly select $100\\text{ children}$ who have cancer and another $100\\text{ children}$ who do not have cancer and compare where the children live.",

  "solution": "Statement I is not viable; it is impractical and unethical to conduct an experiment in this situation.\n\nStatements II and III are viable; the former is an observational study, and the latter is a case controlled study, both of which would work.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
