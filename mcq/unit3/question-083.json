  "question_text": "Researchers are curious if there is a connection between childhood cancer rates and living near power lines. What could be a viable way to investigate this relationship? I. Randomly select $200\\text{ children}$ and move half of them near power lines while ensuring the other half do not live near power lines then compare cancer rates. II. Randomly select $100\\text{ children}$ who live near power lines and another $100\\text{ children}$ who do not live near power lines then investigate cancer rates of the respective groups. III. Randomly select $100\\text{ children}$ who have cancer and another $100\\text{ children}$ who do not have cancer and compare where the children live.",
