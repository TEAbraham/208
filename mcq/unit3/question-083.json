  "question_text": "Researchers are curious if there is a connection between childhood cancer rates and living near power lines.\nWhat could be a viable way to investigate this relationship?\nI. Randomly select $200\\text{ children}$ and move half of them near power lines while ensuring the other half do not live near power lines then compare cancer rates.\nII. Randomly select $100\\text{ children}$ who live near power lines and another $100\\text{ children}$ who do not live near power lines then investigate cancer rates of the respective groups.\nIII. Randomly select $100\\text{ children}$ who have cancer and another $100\\text{ children}$ who do not have cancer and compare where the children live.",
