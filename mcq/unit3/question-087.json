  "solution": "A common response variable is a type of lurking variable that is neither explanatory nor response, but still affects the relationship between both these variables.\n\nWhile it is absurd to think that ice cream causes boating accidents, one may conclude that during warmer months, people are more likely to eat ice cream and are more likely to go boating. Therefore, temperature is a common response variable since it acts on both explanatory (ice cream sales) and response (boating accidents) variables.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
