  "solution": "In this case, we are imposing a treatment which makes this an experiment, and not an observational study. We can eliminate Choice 'D'.\n\nThe treatment being imposed is the type of detergent. We can eliminate Choices 'B' and 'E'.\n\nSince the manager thinks the detergent's light and dark colors may react differently to the types of detergent, we are going to want to block the colors, which means a completely randomized design would be inappropriate. We can eliminate Choice 'A'.\n\nChoice 'C' is our answer.",
