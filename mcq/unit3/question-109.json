  "question_text": "A manufacturer of hair care products believes that they have developed a new formula for their shampoo that will leave hair feeling softer and silkier. The shampoo that contains the new formula looks and smells like the original formula, so those who use the shampoo would not be able to tell the two formulas apart.<br>Several volunteers who use the company's shampoo have agreed to help them test their theory, and since the group of volunteers is very diverse, the manufacturer believes that the volunteers actually would be a good representation of the population of individuals who would use their shampoo.<br>For this study, each volunteer will have the hair on one side of their head shampooed with the original formula and the hair on the other side of their head shampooed with the new formula. Which side receives which formula will be determined at random and the hair on the left side of the head will always be shampooed first.<br>After the hair is then dried and styled to the individual's preference, each individual will be asked to rate how soft and silky their hair feels on the side with the original formula and on the side with the new formula. Ratings will be based on a scale from $1$ to $5$ with $1$ being \"not soft and silky\" and $5$ being \"the most soft and silky\". The difference between the new formula rating and the old formula rating will be recorded for each individual in the study.<br>What would it mean for this experiment to be double blind? Why is this an important characteristic of the experiment?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "In a double-blind study, neither the individuals who are receiving the treatment nor the individuals who interact with them will know which treatment is received. If an individual who is being treated (in this case a volunteer who is having their hair shampooed) has a knowledge of which treatment was received, this knowledge can affect the perceived effectiveness of the treatment leading to bias in the ratings.\n\nAlso, if the individuals who are interacting with those receiving the treatment (in this case the people who are shampooing the hair) know which treatment is being applied, they may unintentionally communicate information to the individuals receiving treatment that could, in turn, affect how the treatment is perceived.\n\nFor example, if the individual who is shampooing hair knows that the new formula is being used on the left side of the head, they may spend more time running their fingers through the hair on that side to see if they themselves think it feels softer and silkier. This might affect how the individual whose hair is being shampooed rates the feeling of soft and silky on that side of their head.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'A' and 'B' are incorrect. Someone must know which side (and which rating) corresponds to which formula. Otherwise, there would be no way to analyze results! Also, double blinding may reduce the potential for bias in the ratings, but cannot ensure that the ratings of the two formulas will be entirely free from bias. Perhaps some people will always believe that the hair on the right side of their head is softest and silkiest for some unknown reason.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. While the meaning of double-blind has been described correctly, the description of why a double blind study is important has not been stated correctly. If individuals do not feel a difference in the softness and silkiness of the hair on both sides of the head, then it is important for the researchers to know this.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. The hair itself will not be able to provide ratings of how soft and silky it feels! Also, the researchers do not necessarily want the hair to feel equally soft and silky with both formulas. In fact, they are hoping that hair shampooed with the new formula will feel softer and silkier as they believe the new formula will have this effect.",
