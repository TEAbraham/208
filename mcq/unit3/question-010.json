  "question_text": "Robert and Kaliyah are working together on their end of the school year Statistics project. They want to test texting speeds on two different types of cell phones to see which cell phone has the keyboard that allows for the greatest typing speed. The plan is to recruit $60$ fellow students and split them into two groups and compare the results against each other.<br>Robert's plan is to have the participants select the phone they would like to text on, while Kaliyah's plan is to randomly assign the students to a group.<br>Whose plan will give the most trustworthy conclusion?",

  "solution": "When collecting data for an observational study or experiment, it is important to make sure the groups are even, or as even as possible. Allowing subjects to select their own groups will not allow the groups to have a good mix of skills.\n\nIn this case, Robert's plan allows subjects to select their own treatment, therefore his plan is untrustworthy. In fact, data collection without a chance process will most always result in untrustworthy results. Therefore, Kaliyah's plan will result in the most trustworthy results as her plan includes a chance process when she randomly assigns the subjects to their group.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
