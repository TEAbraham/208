  "question_text": "The athletic director of a large university is curious about community opinion of a new initiative to open a sports arena for both community members and college students to use. The cost of this initiative will be funded through a county-wide sales tax.<br>The athletic director went to several different health clubs and asked members there if they would support the initiative. Out of $500$ people surveyed, $374$ said they would support the sports arena.<br>[/question-stem] What is a type of bias present here? Furthermore, is the true population proportion who support this initiative higher, lower, or about the same as the sample proportion?[/question-stem]",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "This survey demonstrates undercoverage by leaving out a huge part of the population, specifically, people who do not go to health clubs. Active people, or the type of people who go to health clubs, will likely be more supportive of the sports arena, and are more likely to the expendable income to afford an increase in sales tax to fund this arena since they can afford health club fees.\n\nTherefore, the sample proportion is too high, and the true proportion who support the arena is lower than the sample.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
