  "solution": "A control group helps serve as a baseline to compare the effects of one treatment against the status quo.\n\nFor example, subjects on a new weight loss drug may have lost weight, but they might have lost weight regardless of the new drug. A control group would help to compare weight loss of the group on the new drug against weight loss of the group on a placebo.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
