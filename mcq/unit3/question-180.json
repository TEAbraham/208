  "correct_answer": "Choice ‘B’ is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nOur goal is to simulate a $60$% likelihood.\n\nThe assignment of digits $00-59$ allows for $60$ unique two-digit values to represent $60$% likelihood. The remaining digits $60-99$ represent the $40$ unique two-digit values that represent the other $40$% of student-athletes who do not receive a scholarship.\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect: Using digits $0 - 4$ simulates a $50$% likelihood as there are 5 unique digits between $0$ and $4$, inclusive.\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect: Using digits $0 - 6$ simulates a $70$% likelihood as there are 7 unique digits between $0$ and $6$, inclusive.\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect: While option II is correct, option IV simulates a $70$% likelihood, as explained above.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect: Using digits $00 - 60$ simulates a $61$% likelihood as there are 61 unique two-digit values between $00$ and $60$, inclusive.",
