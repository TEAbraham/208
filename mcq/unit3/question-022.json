  "solution": "As a reminder, we are looking for what is not a valid reason for using random selection.\n\nChoice 'D' is wrong for a couple of reasons. First, Choice 'D' would be true if it said, \"Random assignment of treatments will allow the researchers to determine a causal relationship.\"\n\nSecond, random assignment of treatments is a feature of experiments, not surveys, so it is not applicable in this situation.\n\nThe other explanations are true advantages of using random selection in surveys.",
