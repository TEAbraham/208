  "question_text": "Students, and people in general, have different styles and preferences of learning new material. An AP Statistics teacher is interested in two types of instruction:<br>The teacher decides to randomly divide his current AP Statistics class into two equal groups. One group will get the traditional instruction and the other group will get the progressive instruction. At the end of one month, the teacher will compare the amount of learning by each group in the form of a test, given in the style of the instruction each group used for the past month.<br>Which of the following best describes why a completely randomized design is an appropriate design to use in this situation?",
