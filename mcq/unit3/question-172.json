  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "question_text": "A scientist wants to test three different laundry fabric softeners.<br>Of a total of $150\\text{ towels}$, $50$ were randomly selected and washed with a certain fabric softener. Another $50$ randomly selected towels were washed with a different fabric softener, and the remaining $50\\text{ towels}$ were washed with the third fabric softener.<br>Each laundry load was done with the same detergent, same water temperature, and on the same washing machine. A total of $50$ trained observers then felt the towels from each of the three treatment groups for softness. The response variable will be which towel the observers say is the softest.<br>Which of the following could be a problem with this experiment?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The trained observers should NOT know which type of fabric softeners they are using as this could result in bias toward a certain brand.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; testing\n50\n towels\nof each softener yields plenty of data.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; one could argue the need for a control group, but a placebo makes no sense in this experiment.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; it makes sense to use trained volunteers in this case because they may be better at detecting sensitive differences in softness than a lay person.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; there do not appear to be any obvious lurking variables as the problem states that the experiment uses the same detergent, water temperature, and washing machine.",
