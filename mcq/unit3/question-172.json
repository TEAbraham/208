  "question_text": "A scientist wants to test three different laundry fabric softeners.<br>Of a total of $150\\text{ towels}$, $50$ were randomly selected and washed with a certain fabric softener. Another $50$ randomly selected towels were washed with a different fabric softener, and the remaining $50\\text{ towels}$ were washed with the third fabric softener.<br>Each laundry load was done with the same detergent, same water temperature, and on the same washing machine. A total of $50$ trained observers then felt the towels from each of the three treatment groups for softness. The response variable will be which towel the observers say is the softest.<br>Which of the following could be a problem with this experiment?",
