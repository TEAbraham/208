  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe engineer is collecting data in order to solve a problem. The issue we have is that we are unaware of the problem that the engineer is trying to solve.\n\nWhen looking at problems the engineer could be investigating, the obvious ones are effectiveness, compatibility, comfort, and design. Once the engineer decides which keyboard they want to use for the new laptop, they can then customize the computer with the color keyboard of their choice.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. To compare the keyboards, the engineer will definitely be looking at the comfort of the keyboard.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. When designing a new laptop, the engineer will be looking at the design and how the keyboard fits in.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. The cost of the keyboards will be a factor in the design and implementation of the new laptop.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The feel of the keyboard could definitely be a deciding factor in which keyboard is selected for the new design.",
