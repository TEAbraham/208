  "solution": "The engineer is collecting data in order to solve a problem. The issue we have is that we are unaware of the problem that the engineer is trying to solve.\n\nWhen looking at problems the engineer could be investigating, the obvious ones are effectiveness, compatibility, comfort, and design. Once the engineer decides which keyboard they want to use for the new laptop, they can then customize the computer with the color keyboard of their choice.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
