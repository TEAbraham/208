  "question_text": "A researcher decides she is going to do an observational study regarding civil engineering. She selects a random sample of $1500$ civil engineers that have a job in the United States to be a part of the study. Which of the following would be the population in which it would be the most reasonable to generalize the results of the study?",

  "solution": "In an observational study, investigators examine data for a sample of individuals in order to investigate a topic of interest for a population. It is important to note that you cannot prove cause and effect from an observational study because treatments are not imposed.\n\nHowever, you can make generalizations and determinations from an observational study. It is only appropriate to make generalizations about a population based on samples that are randomly selected or otherwise representative of the population. Therefore, wherever the sample has been selected from is what we can generalize from. So, in this study, we can only generalize about the civil engineers from the United States.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
