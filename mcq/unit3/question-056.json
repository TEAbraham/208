  "solution": "A cluster sample is a sampling method that divides samples into random groups (in this case: floors) and then measures all of the samples within a group.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' - The survey would be a simple random sample if the rooms were randomly chosen out of all the rooms in the hotel.\n\nChoice 'B' - The survey would be stratified if the hotel rooms were sorted on some characteristic (for example, rooms occupied by families with children and rooms occupied by adults only) and then a random sample was taken from each group.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' - Blocking and matched pair are terms used only in the design of experiments, not surveys.",
