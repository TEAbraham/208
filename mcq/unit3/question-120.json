  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Statement I is incorrect; a census attempts to contact everybody in the population, not just a sample of the population.\n\nStatement II is incorrect; treatments are imposed in experiments but NOT in observational studies.\n\nStatement III is correct; matched pairs experiments either pair people together by similarity or test an individual against themselves, reducing variability in results.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
