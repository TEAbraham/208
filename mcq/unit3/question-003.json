  "solution": "Shane and Emma want to investigate whether gender influences the opinions of those who watch Prime Time Wrestling. That is, they want to determine whether gender explains or predicts the opinion (response) that an individual will hold. The explanatory variable is gender, and the response variable is opinion on Prime Time Wrestling.\n\nTherefore, Choice 'B' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as it reverses the explanatory and response variables.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. While \"Male\" is one possible value of the explanatory variable and believing that Prime Time Wrestling is \"All Drama\" is one possible value for the response variable, the explanatory and response variables both describe a characteristic of an individual in a more general way. The actual gender, and the actual belief are too specific to be considered the explanatory and response variables. Furthermore, males were not as likely to report \"All Drama\" as their belief as were females.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. While females were more likely than males to feel that Prime Time Wrestling is \"All Drama\", these two responses are also too specific to be considered the explanatory and response variables.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. While it is true that gender and belief about Prime Time Wrestling are both categorical variables, an explanatory/response relationship is still being investigated. Specifically, Shane and Emma want to investigate whether gender (the explanation) influences opinion (the response).",
