  "question_text": "Migraines can be debilitating, especially for people who experience them frequently. Chronic migraine sufferers are often told to ingest some form of caffeine to relieve some of the pain. Does caffeine really reduce pain due to chronic migraines?<br>To explore this, $100$ adults who experience migraines volunteered to participate in a study to compare the effects of caffeine on migraine symptoms. Each volunteer is assigned at random to one of two groups and is provided either a daily capsule that contains caffeine or a placebo. Each volunteer will monitor the amount of and severity of migraines they experience over the next month and results will be compared for each group.<br>What type of experimental design is being described?",
