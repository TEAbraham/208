Chronic migraine sufferers are often told to ingest some form of caffeine to relieve some of the pain.  Does caffeine really reduce pain due to chronic migraines?  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">To explore this, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100$</span> adults who experience migraines volunteered to participate in a study to compare the effects of caffeine on migraine symptoms.  Each volunteer is assigned at random to one of two groups and is provided either a daily capsule that contains caffeine or a placebo.  Each volunteer will monitor the amount of and severity of migraines they experience over the next month and results will be compared for each group.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What type of experimental design is being described?</div>",
