  "question_text": "Millions of people suffer from migraine headaches. A research team believes it has created a new medication that will help those who suffer from migraines. They recruit $100$ people who suffer from migraines and give all of them the new medication to take when a migraine headache occurs. They are asked to rate the effectiveness of the medication in helping reduce the effects of the migraine out of $10$. Overall, the sample rates the medication $7.6$ on average.<br>Can the research team prove that the medication caused the a reduction in the migraine effects?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe researchers had two choices of studies they could've performed: an observational study or an experiment. In an observational study, the researchers do not attempt to influence the response variable, meaning that different groups within the sample do not receive different treatments. In an experiment, different treatments are imposed to different experimental units.\n\nIn the above case, since all members of the study received the medication, this was an observational study, not an experiment. And since this was an observational study, it is not possible to to determine a causal relationship between variables using data collected in an observational study. So the researchers cannot prove the medication caused the reduction of symptoms.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Although the rating is a 7.6\n, the number is irrelevant in trying to prove a cause-and-effect because it's an observational study, not an experiment.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. In order to see if the medicine does work, we would need to have patients who suffered from migraines, but we would need a well designed random experiment.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. 100\npeople would be a sufficient enough number of patients to create a well designed random experiment to prove cause and effect if needed.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. To determine if a result is statistically significant, it must be so high it can't happen by chance. We would need to run a test of significance to determine this.",
