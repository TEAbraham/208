  "solution": "The researchers had two choices of studies they could've performed: an <strong>observational study</strong> or an <strong>experiment</strong>. In an observational study, the researchers do not attempt to influence the response variable, meaning that different groups within the sample do not receive different treatments. In an experiment, different treatments are imposed to different experimental units. \n\nIn the above case, since all members of the study received the medication, this was an observational study, not an experiment. And since this was an observational study, it is not possible to to determine a causal relationship between variables using data collected in an observational study. So the researchers cannot prove the medication caused the reduction of symptoms. \n\n<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is correct. ",

    "B": "<strong>Choice 'B'</strong> is incorrect. In order to see if the medicine does work, we would need to have patients who suffered from migraines, but we would need a well designed random experiment. ",
