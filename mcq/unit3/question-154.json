  "question_text": "Suppose a teacher decided to offer an after-school study session the day before a $100\\text{ point}$ test. The $34\\text{ students}$ who came to this study session averaged scores $8\\text{ points}$ higher on the test than the $72\\text{ students}$ who did not come to the study session. Based on this information, what may one conclude?",
