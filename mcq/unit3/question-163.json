They ask the following question.<br>\"Several professional sports teams have team names and/or mascots that are considered offensive to many Native Americans. Do you believe that these teams should be forced to change their team names and mascots even though such a change would likely cost the team millions of dollars and could potentially upset loyal fans who would then have to go out and purchase all new merchandise in order to show their support?\"<br>The results of this survey are most likely to suffer from what type of bias?",
