  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">A manufacturer of hair care products believes that they have developed a new formula for their shampoo that will leave hair feeling softer and silkier.  The shampoo that contains the new formula looks and smells like the original formula, so those who use the shampoo would not be able to tell the two formulas apart.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Several volunteers who use the company's shampoo have agreed to help them test their theory, and since the group of volunteers is very diverse, the manufacturer believes that the volunteers actually would be a good representation of the population of individuals who would use their shampoo.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">For this study, each volunteer will have the hair on one side of their head shampooed with the original formula and the hair on the other side of their head shampooed with the new formula.  Which side receives which formula will be determined at random and the hair on the left side of the head will always be shampooed first.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">After the hair is then dried and styled to the individual's preference, each individual will be asked to rate how soft and silky their hair feels on the side with the original formula and on the side with the new formula.
