  "solution": "A double-blind experiment is conducted such that neither the subjects nor the individuals running the experiment know which subjects are receiving which treatment.\n\nThe experiment could be administered in such a way that the subjects do not know which pill they receive, and a third party is hired to administer the treatments, so the researchers who are measuring the pain also do not know who is getting which treatment.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the subject would know which foot they are kicking off of, the left or right.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; the subjects would know if they are running or swimming.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the subjects would know if they are taking the ACT prep course.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; the subjects would know if they are exercising or not. Furthermore, this is not an experiment since no treatment is imposed.",
