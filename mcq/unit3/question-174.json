  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "In this case, we are looking for the most effective method, which means we want to eliminate as many lurking and confounding variables as possible.\n\nOne thing to take into consideration is whether or not the subjects receive only one treatment or both treatments (running for twenty minutes and jumping rope). If we divide the subjects into two groups and have each of them only do one activity (one group does jump rope and the other runs for twenty minutes), this could present a problem.\n\nBy doing this, we could end up with a group where the metabolic rate is much faster than the other group. We would not be able to distinguish if it is the activity that burns more calories or if it is because the subjects had a higher metabolic rate. Therefore, we want to find a design where the subjects receive both treatments. Choices 'A', 'B', and 'C' can be eliminated.\n\nChoice 'A' can be eliminated as this is a voluntary response bias.\n\nChoice 'D' would not be the most effective method due to the fact something could happen in between the days that would not allow us to draw a proper conclusion. A variable to take into account would be that the subjects are fatigued and sore on the second day due to the first day's activity. We would not be able to distinguish if it was the first activity or the weariness on the second day that caused more calories being burnt on the first day.\n\nChoice 'E' is the most effective as the groups were randomly divided and received both treatments.",
