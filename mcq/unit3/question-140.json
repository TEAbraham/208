  "solution": "Three major principles of good experimental design are control, randomize, and replicate.\n\nIdeally, this experiment should be conducted in a double-blind manner, where the subjects and the experiment administrator are all unaware of who receives which treatment.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the condition of replication is met as 200 subjects\nare involved in each treatment group.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; a placebo is necessary to act as a control group. This helps serve as a baseline to compare how effective these drugs are compared to nothing.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; a matched pairs experiment would not work in this context as the subjects cannot reasonably perform two treatments.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the subjects should be randomly placed in groups to reduce bias.",
