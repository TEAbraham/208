  "correct_answer": "<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is the correct answer. ",
  "solution": "In a <strong>completely randomized experiment</strong>, treatments are assigned to experimental units completely at random. Using <strong>random assignment</strong> will hopefully balance the effects of the uncontrolled (confounding) variables so we can attribute the difference in the response to the treatments. \n\nMethods for randomly assigning treatments in experimental units in a completely randomized design must have a chance process involved. Some examples of methods are using a random number generator, a random digit table, drawing names out of a hat, etc. The only choice above that won't result in random assignment is <strong>Choice 'E'</strong>. \n\n<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is correct. ",
  "distractor_explanations": {
    "B": "<strong>Choice 'B'</strong> is incorrect. The hat method is also an acceptable method of creating random groups for an experiment. ",
    "D": "<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is incorrect. Since a coin a chance process, it is an acceptable method of creating random groups for an experiment."
