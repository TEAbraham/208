  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn a completely randomized experiment, treatments are assigned to experimental units completely at random. Using random assignment will hopefully balance the effects of the uncontrolled (confounding) variables so we can attribute the difference in the response to the treatments.\n\nMethods for randomly assigning treatments in experimental units in a completely randomized design must have a chance process involved. Some examples of methods are using a random number generator, a random digit table, drawing names out of a hat, etc. The only choice above that won't result in random assignment is Choice 'E'.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A\" is incorrect. Assigning the volunteers numbers and selecting the groups with a random number generator is an acceptable way to create random groups for an experiment.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The hat method is also an acceptable method of creating random groups for an experiment.\n\nChoice 'C\" is incorrect. Assigning the volunteers numbers and selecting the groups using a random digit table is an acceptable method to use to create random groups for an experiment.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Since a coin a chance process, it is an acceptable method of creating random groups for an experiment.",
