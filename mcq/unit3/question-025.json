  "question_text": "The music industry is a huge financial industry.  When a song is played on a radio station, the musicians are entitled to a royalty payment.  It would be impossible to listen to every song played on every radio station to determine the royalties due to each musician.  Instead, The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) randomly samples radio stations and times of day to listen to the music being played and to determine the royalties due to each musician. Which of the following statements is FALSE?",
