An observational study is being planned to compare the average number of colds self-proclaimed vegetarians suffer from each year with the average number of colds non-vegetarians suffer from each year.<br>Which of the following represents the biggest problem with this type of study?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Confounding occurs when we cannot tell whether it is the variable under study, some other variable, or some combination of variables that caused the effect that we observed.\n\nIf our study indicates that vegetarians do get fewer colds on average, we will still be unsure whether this is attributable to their self-selected vegetarian diet, a healthier lifestyle overall, some other variable common to vegetarians, or some combination of all of these things.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Blinding is a feature of experiments, not observational studies.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. We are often able to notice relationships between an explanatory variable (vegetarian or non-vegetarian diet) and the response variable (# of colds) in an observational study. However, an observational study may not be used to show that the type of diet is the thing that is causing the number of colds.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Undercoverage occurs when a specific group is left out of the sample. For example, nothing here suggests that those who are following a gluten-free diet are left out of the study. The fact that they are following a gluten-free diet is simply not a variable of interest to us. However, different types of diets could present another type of confounding.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. The placebo effect is a feature of experiments, not observational studies. There was no placebo given.",
