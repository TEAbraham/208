These $35$ households had an average income of $\\$42,035$ and standard deviation of $\\$14,352$.<br>Why might it be dangerous to generalize the sociologist’s results to the rest of the town?<br>I. There was undercoverage.<br>II. The sample was not random enough.<br>III. The sample was too small.",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Statement I is true; since the sociologist visited homes during the day, he missed out on people who are not home during the day.\n\nStatement II is true; it is likely that the block surveyed could be different (less wealthy or more wealthy) than the rest of the town.\n\nStatement III is false; a sample of size n=35\nis more than adequate to perform T procedures.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
