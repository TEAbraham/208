By printing the same amount of labels from each printer, she is more than likely looking at which printer will make shipping her products easiest. \n\n<strong>Choice 'B'</strong> is correct. ",
  "distractor_explanations": {
    "A": "<strong>Choice 'A'</strong> is incorrect. Since the printers are just printing the shipping labels, the printers will not sell the products. ",
    "C": "<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is incorrect. The shop owner would already know which printer is the cheapest because she already purchased them. ",
    "D": "<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is incorrect.  Although she could technically determine which printer sounds the best, this will not help her business. ",
    "E": "<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is incorrect. The owner could technically use two printers, but she would not be comparing the printers after purchase if she was going to keep two."
