  "solution": "The point of stratifying is to divide the sample in such a way as to reduce variability within each stratum. There must be something about the strata such that one group of individuals may feel differently than the other group.\n\nIt is possible that the male and female students feel different about the healthiness of the schoolâ€™s food, making this a good variable to stratify on.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; this process does not stratify the actual respondents.\n\nChoices 'B', 'D', and 'E' are incorrect; these selections divide the students, but not in any clear way that would change the way the students feel in terms of healthy school lunches.",
