  "solution": "An experiment should control for the effects of outside variables, and while this may be difficult to do at times, it is not a disadvantage of doing an experiment.\n\nRather, it is what makes an experiment valuable to us! By controlling for outside factors, we can determine whether it really is the treatment that is causing the effect that we observe.\n\nFor these reasons, Choice 'E' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D' are incorrect. Each of these choices does identify a valid potential disadvantage of conducting an experiment.",
