  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe doctor is putting together a study in order to collect data about her new weight loss pill. The hope is that after collecting the data, she would be able to make a conclusion with certainty about whether the pill helped lower blood pressure.\n\nBut, the doctor did not take into account the outside factors that might lower blood pressure that aren't her pill. Since she did not tell her patients to keep the rest of their lives the same, she cannot be sure whether he pill lowered the blood pressure, or the other factors. Therefore, we are unsure whether the data we collected is accurate.\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Even if people are not recruited randomly, with random assignment we can still run an experiment, but neither happened in this case.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Although the doctor developed the pill, it still needs to be proven to help lower blood pressure through a study.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. As noted above, the doctor cannot be certain the blood pressure decrease is due to the pill or the outside factors.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since the 30\npeople we all prescribed the pill, she cannot compare the pill-takers to non pill-takers.",
