  "question_text": "Many office workers experience sleepiness after lunch that slows down their productivity. A psychologist runs a completely randomized experiment in an attempt to identify the causes of this sleepiness. $144\\text{ office workers}$ are randomly assigned to one of the following groups:<br>Group A is assigned to a low-calorie lunch and a brightly-lit office.\nGroup B is assigned to a low-calorie lunch and a softly-lit office.\nGroup C is assigned to a high-calorie lunch and a brightly-lit office.\nGroup D is assigned to a high-calorie lunch and a softly-lit office.<br>An hour after lunch, all the workers are asked to rate their sleepiness on a scale from $1$ to $10$.<br>Which of the following statements is false?",

  "solution": "Explanatory variables are conditions that are changed in the experiment whose effect on the response variable we are measuring.\n\nSince there are two explanatory variables (lunch and light) and two levels for each explanatory variable, there are a total of four treatments. Choice 'A' is a false statement, and thus the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nIn this case, the explanatory variables tested are type of lunch and type of office lighting, each with two extreme variants. This makes Choices 'D' and 'E' true statements, and thus incorrect answers.\n\nThe experiment is studying\n144\n office workers\n, or the experimental units (subjects). Choice 'C' is a true statement, and thus an incorrect answer.\n\nFinally, the response variable is a measure of sleepiness rated\n1\nto\n10\n. Choice 'B' is a true statement, and thus an incorrect answer.",
