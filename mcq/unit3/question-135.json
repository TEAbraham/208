A psychologist runs a completely randomized experiment in an attempt to identify the causes of this sleepiness. $144\\text{ office workers}$ are randomly assigned to one of the following groups:<br>Group A is assigned to a low-calorie lunch and a brightly-lit office.\nGroup B is assigned to a low-calorie lunch and a softly-lit office.\nGroup C is assigned to a high-calorie lunch and a brightly-lit office.\nGroup D is assigned to a high-calorie lunch and a softly-lit office.<br>An hour after lunch, all the workers are asked to rate their sleepiness on a scale from $1$ to $10$.<br>Which of the following statements is false?",
