A psychologist will investigate this issue using <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$94\\text{ subjects}$</span> who complain of frequent fatigue at the end of the day.  The psychologist will instruct the subjects to drink either soda (<span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$15 - 23\\text{ mg}$</span> caffeine per serving) or coffee (<span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$95 - 150\\text{ mg}$</span> caffeine per serving) when they feel like they cannot stay awake any longer.  The subjects will record the amount of additional time they are able to stay awake.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">While collecting preliminary information from his subjects, the psychologist finds that some work in dimly lit rooms at the end of the day and some work in brightly lit rooms.  Previous studies have shown that brightly lit rooms reduce fatigue.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">On what variable should the experiment be blocked?  Why?</div>",
