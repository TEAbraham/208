  "solution": "Statement I is true. The wording of questions in a survey should remain consistent for all subjects.\n\nStatement II is false. Those who volunteer might not be representative of the population. In volunteer samples, it is common for those with strong opinions to be the only ones who participate.\n\nStatement III is false. A large sample size cannot overcome the flaw of poor representation. For example, it would do no good to sample $50{,}000\\text{ U. S. adults}$ for a presidential poll if only $10\\%$ of those selected were women.",
