  "question_text": "Quick Quiche is a fast-food restaurant that has $150\\text{ locations}$ in the southeast region. The regional manager will randomly select $10\\text{ restaurants}$ to make a surprise inspection. He assigns each restaurant a unique number between $1$ and $150$.\nHe then draws ten pairs of numbers from a random digit table. The manager will make a surprise visit to the restaurants corresponding to those numbers.\nWhich statement best describes the main flaw in the sampling method for this study?",
