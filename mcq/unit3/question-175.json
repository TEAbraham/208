  "question_text": "Suppose a large dog food company has a new prototype that is supposed to prolong the life of dogs. The company randomly selects two groups of $100\\text{ dogs}$ each: one group will be fed this new food for the duration of their entire lives; the other group will be fed the leading competitorâ€™s brand of dog food. Variables such as exercise, location, and medical treatment are all controlled for. However, the company needs to decide whether to use only a specific breed of dog or include a variety of dogs. What is a statistical advantage of using only one specific breed of dog for this study? A statistical disadvantage?",
