  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "The hemlock woolly adelgid is a small invasive insect that came to North America via Japan and is responsible for killing most of the hemlock trees in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. To try to control the destruction of hemlock trees caused by the hemlock woolly adelgid, biologists have released lady beetles from Japan (which are known to be natural predators of the hemlock woolly adelgid) onto several of the remaining healthy hemlock trees in the park.<br>Which of the following describes the experimental units in this study?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Biologists are attempting to control the destruction of hemlock trees caused by the hemlock woolly adelgid. Therefore, the remaining healthy hemlock trees in the park are the experimental units whose health the biologists want to monitor. They are hoping that the introduction of the lady beetles will help to keep these trees healthy.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. The biologists are the researchers.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The Great Smoky Mountains National Park is the setting in which this study takes place. However, the mountains are not receiving the treatment. Rather, trees are receiving the treatment and being observed for the response.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The hemlock woolly adelgids are causing a problem with the health of the hemlock trees. We might think of this insect as the equivalent of terminal cancer in a hemlock tree.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. The lady beetles are the treatment being administered to the healthy hemlock trees in an attempt to keep them healthy.",
