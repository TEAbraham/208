  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The people who are easiest to contact are often not representative of the population. The whole point of sampling is to obtain a sample that can give accurate information about a population.\n\nConvenience samples give samples that are not representative of the population, so they do a poor job of giving information about the population.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; convenience samples rely on contacting people who are easiest to find; therefore, people who are difficult to find will most likely not be contacted. In a simple random sample, everybody needs an equal chance of being selected.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; the term double-blind deals with experiments, not samples.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; this selection describes a voluntary response sample.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; this selection describes a stratified sample.",
