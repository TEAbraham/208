  "question_text": "Bright colors usually attract more attention than dark colors. A clothing store owner wants to investigate whether displaying bright clothing in the front window of the store will increase the volume of shoppers more than displaying dark clothing. The owner decides to change the clothing display once a week. At the beginning of each week, the color of the clothing displayed is randomly chosen to be either bright or dark, and the amount of shoppers for the week is recorded. At the end of the study, the owner determined that the amount of shoppers was greater when bright colors were displayed in the front window. In fact, the owner found the difference to be statistically significant.\nWhat can be concluded from the study?",
