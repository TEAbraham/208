  "solution": "For side-by-side stemplots, the left-hand stemplot is “backward” when you consider its skewness, so the skewness for\n1\nst\nperiod is to the left, because few values are occurring in the low scores and many values in the higher score categories. The distribution is skewed left, not right.\n\nRemember, we are looking for the statement which is false.\n\nChoice 'D' is false, making it correct; since there are few values in the low scores and many values in the higher scores, the distribution is skewed left, not right.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is a true, making it incorrect; visual observation shows larger values for the\n5\nth\nperiod class.\n\nChoice 'B' is true, making it incorrect; both distributions have a modal class that encompasses scores in the\n80\n′\ns\n.\n\nChoice 'C' is true, making it incorrect; this is due to the relatively tight clustering of the data in the\n80\n′\ns\nand\n90\n′\ns\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is true, making it incorrect; from the distribution, we can see that\n5\nth\nperiod had scores that were more concentrated in the high-end and so had a higher average. Thus,\n5\nth\nperiod did better than\n1\nst\nperiod regarding mean scores.",
