  "solution": "The range can be found by:\n\nRange\n=\nMaximum Value\n−\n Minimum  Value\n\nIn this case, when the low outlier of\n23\nis removed we can see the range will decrease. Therefore Choices 'D' and 'E' can be eliminated.\n\nApproximate range with the outlier:\n64\n−\n23\n=\n41\n\nApproximate range without the outlier:\n64\n−\n32\n=\n32\n\nThe interquartile range (IQR) is a resistant measure of spread, and can be found by:\n\nIQR\n=\nQ\n3\n−\nQ\n1\n\nWhen the outlier of\n23\nis removed, the IQR will not change significantly.\n\nTherefore, Choices 'A' and 'B' can be eliminated.",
