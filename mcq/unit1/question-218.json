  "solution": "Statement I is true; the normal distribution is centered around the mean, but mean and the median are equal in every normal distribution.\n\nStatement II is false; only the standard normal curve (SNC) has $\\mu = 0$ and $\\sigma = 1$. There are an infinite number of normal curves, each with its own unique mean and standard deviation.\n\nStatement III is false; the correct fraction of values within $1$ standard deviation of the mean is about $\\dfrac{2}{3}$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
