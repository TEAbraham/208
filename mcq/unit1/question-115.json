  "solution": "The median, in this case, is the $15$th value in the data set. In the first bin ($22\\le \\text{ payroll }<28$) the frequency is $12$, which means the first $12$ values are in that bin.\n\nIn the second bin ($28\\le \\text{ payroll }<34$) there are $5$ values in there which indicates the $13$th, $14$th, $15$th, $16$th, and $17$th value are in there.\n\nSince the $15$th value is the median then the correct choice is Choice 'B'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as the first $12/29$ or $41.3$% of NBA teams are in the payroll. We need the cumulative relative frequency for $50$%.\n\nChoices 'C', 'D', and 'E' are incorrect as the first value in each of those bins would already exceed $50$%.",
