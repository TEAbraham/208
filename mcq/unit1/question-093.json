  "question_text": "Abner and Abijah are brothers who own a painting business together. The mean amount of time it takes Abner to paint a medium sized room is $5.59\\text{ hours}$ with a standard deviation of $0.63\\text{ hours}$ . The mean amount of time it takes  Abijah to paint a medium sized room is $6.11\\text{ hours}$ with a standard deviation of $0.45\\text{ hours}$ . Assuming the amount of time it takes each brother to paint is independent, which of the following is closest to the standard deviation of the difference (Abner - Abijah) in the amount of time it takes for the two brothers to paint a medium sized room?",
