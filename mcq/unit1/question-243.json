A question on one of the previous exams had an average score of $3.10$ with a standard deviation of $2.45$.<br>What was the approximate score achieved by a student that would put him or her in the $87$th percentile on this question?<br>You may assume the scores on this question are approximately normally distributed.",

  "solution": "Using the process of elimination, we can eliminate Choices 'A' and 'B' as we are looking for the 87 percentile. The mean represents 50 percentile in a normal distribution which indicates the score must be above 3.10.\n\nThe easiest way to solve this problem is to use the graphing calculator: Press 2nd then Vars to get into the Distribution menu. Using the InvNorm function enter:\n\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nArea represents the area to the left. In this case, we want the cutoff for the bottom 87%\nso the area would be 0.87\n. The mean and standard deviation are given. Choice 'E' would be our answer.\n\nAn alternative approach to solving this would be to use the z-score formula:\n\nIf x\nis an observation from a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation, the z-score of x\nis\n\nz=\nx-mean \nstandard deviation\n\nNow we need to find the z-score for 87%\neither using Table A or a graphing calculator.\n\nUsing the TI-84 graphing calculator: Press 2nd then Vars to get into the Distribution menu.
