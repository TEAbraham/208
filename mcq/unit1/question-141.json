  "solution": "Since the dotplot displays a bimodal distribution, the situation being displayed most likely is made of two subgroups.\n\nChoice 'E' would likely be bimodal because typical 8-year-olds would be able to run a lower number of laps than typical 15-year-olds. We would expect to see two different subgroups, which we see with the bimodal distribution.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' would likely have a unimodal and symmetric distribution.\n\nChoice 'B' would likely have a unimodal and skewed right distribution. There would be many less expensive cars and a few more expensive cars.\n\nChoice 'C' would likely have a unimodal and symmetric distribution.\n\nChoice 'D' would likely have a unimodal and symmetric distribution.",
