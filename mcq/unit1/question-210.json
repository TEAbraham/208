  "solution": "A z-score measure how many standard deviations a value is above or below the mean. A z-score standardizes the variable so when the units are changed the z-score still remains the same.\n\nExplanation of Distractors Choice 'A' is incorrect the z-score would remain the same not change to negative. Choice 'B' is incorrect as this would represent if the z-score of $1.2$ was in mph and then converted to feet per second and then changed to a negative value. Choice 'C' is incorrect as the z-score of $1.2$ doesn't change to $0$. Choice 'D' is incorrect as this would represent if the z-score of $1.2$ was in mph and then converted to feet per second\n\nImagine the average speed of an AP Statistics student throwing a tennis ball against the wall had a mean and standard deviation of $24 \\text{ mph}$ and $5\\text{ mph}$, respectively. If a student threw the ball at a speed of $30\\text{ mph}$ the z-score would be:\n\n$$\\text{z-score}=\\frac { \\text{statistic - parameter} }{ \\text{standard deviation of statistic} } =\\frac { 30 \\text{ mph}-24\\text{ mph} }{ 5\\text{ mph} } =1.2$$\n\nNotice there are no units as $\\text{mph}$ would cancel out from the numerator and denominator.\n\nIf we converted miles per hour to feet per second:\n\n$$30 \\text{ mph} = \\dfrac { 30\\text{ miles} }{ 1\\text{ hour} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 1\\text{ hour} }{ 60\\text{ minutes} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 1\\text{ minutes} }{ 60\\text{ seconds} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 5280\\text{ feet} }{ 1\\text{ mile} } =44\\text{ ft/sec}$$\n\n$$24 \\text{ mph} = \\dfrac { 24\\text{ miles} }{ 1\\text{ hour} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 1\\text{ hour} }{ 60\\text{ minutes} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 1\\text{ minutes} }{ 60\\text{ seconds} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 5280\\text{ feet} }{ 1\\text{ mile} } =35.2\\text{ ft/sec}$$\n\n$$5 \\text{ mph} = \\dfrac { 5\\text{ miles} }{ 1\\text{ hour} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 1\\text{ hour} }{ 60\\text{ minutes} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 1\\text{ minutes} }{ 60\\text{ seconds} } \\bullet \\dfrac { 5280\\text{ feet} }{ 1\\text{ mile} } =7\\frac { 1 }{ 3 } \\text{ ft/sec}$$\n\nCalculating the z-score using the values for $\\text{ft/sec}$:\n\n$$z-score=\\frac { \\text{statistic - parameter} }{ \\text{standard deviation of statistic} } =\\frac { 44 \\text{ ft/sec} -35.2 \\text{ ft/sec} }{ 7\\frac { 1 }{ 3 }} =1.2$$\n\nTherefore, we can see the z-scores stay the same when units are changed.",
