  "solution": "The first step is to determine the height of this uniform distribution. Since every density function has an area of 1, the height of this distribution is 0.5, making it a rectangular shape that’s 2 wide by 0.5 high.\n\nNow find the probability that the random variable X takes on a value between 0.71 and 1.33. The height of this rectangle is 0.5, and the length is (1.33−0.71)=0.62.\n\nTherefore, the area is 0.5⋅0.62=0.31.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
