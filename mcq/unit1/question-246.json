  "solution": "If $x$ is an observation from a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation, the z-score of $x$ is:\n\n$$z=\\dfrac { \\text{x-mean }}{ \\text{standard deviation} } $$\n\nUsing process of elimination, we can eliminate Choices 'A' and 'D' as $63.6$ and $x$ are incorrectly placed in the numerator.\n\nNow we need to find the z-score for $82\\%$ either using Table A or a graphing calculator. The reason for $82\\%$ and not $18\\%$ is we are looking for the cutoff for the top$18\\%$ which equivalent to the bottom $82\\%$. Table A and the graphing calculator takes the bottom area(cumulative area) also known as the area to the left.\n\nUsing table A: Look in the middle of the chart look for an entry closest to $0.82$. It is $0.8212$. This is the entry corresponding to z = $0.92$.\n\nUsing the TI-84 graphing calculator: Press 2nd then Vars to get into the Distribution menu. Using the InvNorm function enter:\n\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nArea represents the area to the left. In this case, we want the cutoff for the bottom $82\\%$ of heights so the area would be $0.82$.\n\nThe mean, $\\mu $, is represented by $0$ and the standard deviation,$\\sigma$, is represented by $1$ because we have standardized the variable $x$.\n\nChoice 'B' is eliminated as the z-score is $0.92$ and not $-0.92$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as the z-score for the top $18 \\%$ was never found.",
