  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe data given to the manager is representing in a bar chart. There is not much data given in the graph, other than the color of a car. (For reference, we do not suggest that you create a graph without a title, or some context!)\n\nSince the graph only shows the color of the car, we believe that the sales team member is trying to communicate the color distribution of the most recent car sales.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. Since the manager is not given the sales prices of the cars sold, we cannot find the average sales price.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. The graph only represents color of the car, it does not communicate the type or model of car sold.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The graph does not mention any members of the sales team, just color of car.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since color is not a numeric value, we cannot find the average of the data points.",
