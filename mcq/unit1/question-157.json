  "question_text": "Recently, a community group held a 5K Race/Fun Walk to raise money for local charities.  The event was advertised as being appropriate for all ages and ability levels.  Sure enough, on race day, entrants ranged from the most competitive fitness enthusiasts who ran the race at their top speed, to grandparents walking the course at a leisurely pace with their young grandchildren.
