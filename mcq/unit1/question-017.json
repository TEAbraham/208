  "solution": "Each variable choice describes a specific characteristic of a home that is being listed for sale. A quantitative variable describes a characteristic of the home that can be measured or counted, while a categorical variable describes a characteristic based upon the home being able to be placed into a certain category.\n\nA zip code is a numerical code used by the post office to more quickly and accurately identify the location of a specific address. Since a zip code is described using numbers, it would be easy to conclude that zip code is a quantitative variable. This is not the case however. A zip code does not measure or count anything about the home being listed. It is simply a label that groups the home into a specific area of the country. As such, it must be considered a categorical variable, which makes Choice 'E' the correct answer..\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Area is measured in square feet and will be described using a numerical value. Therefore, area is a quantitative variable.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The list price of a home would identify \"how many\" dollars the current owner is asking for his/her property. Since there is a certain number of dollars being asked for, list price is a quantitative variable.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Number of bathrooms is a quantitative variable.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Number of bedrooms is a quantitative variable.",
