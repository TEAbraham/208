  "title": "Scoliosis and Cobb Angles: A Histogram",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "The Cobb angle measures the angle of bend in the spine and is used to assess the severity of scoliosis. More severe cases of scoliosis will present with larger Cobb angles. An angle of less than $20$ degrees is considered mild, while an angle of more than $50$ degrees is considered severe. Angles between $20$ and $50$ degrees (inclusive) are considered moderate.<br>A random sample of $36$ scoliosis patients was selected and the Cobb angle for each of these patients was recorded. The data is shown in the histogram below.<br>What percent of the patients in this sample had moderate scoliosis?",

  "solution": "The histogram shows the count (or frequency) of patients having various Cobb angle measurements. By matching up the height of each bar with the corresponding angle measure in degrees, we can determine how many patients had Cobb angle measurements falling within each interval along the horizontal axis. It is important to remember however, that a measurement of exactly\n50\ndegrees will show up in the bar to the right of where\n50\nappears on the horizontal axis.\n\nFrom the histogram we know:\n\nAngles between\n20\nand\n50\ndegrees (inclusive) are considered moderate scoliosis. Since\n12\n+\n6\nor\n18\npatients had angles of at least\n20\ndegrees, but less than\n40\ndegrees, we know that at least\n18\n36\nor\n50\n%\nof patients had moderate scoliosis. However, this percentage could be even higher. It is possible that one or both of the\n2\npatients with angles of at least\n50\ndegrees but less than\n60\ndegrees had angles of exactly\n50\ndegrees. If this were the case, then these patients would also be considered to have moderate scoliosis and more than\n18\n36\nor more than\n50\n%\nof patients had moderate scoliosis.\n\nWhile we can't say with certainty that exactly\n50\n%\nof patients had moderate scoliosis, we do know that at least\n50\n%\nof patients had moderate scoliosis.\n\nChoice 'C' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Exactly\n18\npatients had angles of at least\n20\ndegrees but less than\n50\ndegrees. In this situation, the number\n18\nis a frequency and not a percentage.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. More than\n18\n%\nof the patients in this survey had moderate scoliosis.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. While it may be true that exactly\n50\n%\nof patients had moderate scoliosis, we can't be certain of this fact.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It is possible that more than\n50\n%\nof patients had moderate scoliosis.",
