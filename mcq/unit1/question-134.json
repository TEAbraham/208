  "solution": "To determine if there are any outliers we need to first calculate the value for the Interquartile Range (IQR).\n\n$$IQR=Q3-Q1$$\n\n$$IQR=54.2-32.5$$\n\n$$IQR=21.7$$\n\nTo determine if we have any high-value outliers the following formula can be used:\n\n$$Outlier > Q3+1.5\\times (IQR)$$\n\n$$Outlier > 54.2+1.5(21.7)$$\n\n$$Outlier > 86.75$$\n\nWe can see that we have a maximum value of $88.7$ which is greater than $86.75$ indicating $88.7$ is an outlier. Since we do not know all the values, there may be some outliers between $86.75$ and $88.7$. Right now we can say we have at least $1$ outlier.\n\nAs a result, Choices 'A' and 'C' can be eliminated.\n\nTo determine if we have any low-value outliers the following formula can be used:\n\n$$Outlier < Q1-1.5\\times (IQR)$$\n\n$$Outlier < 32.5-1.5(21.7)$$\n\n$$Outlier < -0.05$$\n\nIn this case, there are no low outliers. Therefore, we are not guaranteed to have at least $2$ outliers. We may or may not, but since we do not know the individual values, we cannot say for certain if we have at least $2$ or even less than $2$ outliers.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' can be eliminated.\n\nChoice 'B' is our answer.",
