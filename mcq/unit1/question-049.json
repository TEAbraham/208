She has been comparing the cost of living in both cities and has come up with budgets for both cities. These budgets (as percents of her salary per year) are displayed in the pie charts below.<br><br><br>If both jobs pay $\\$50{,}000$ annually, how much more would Kim pay for housing and utilities in San Francisco than in Los Angeles?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Both pie charts represent housing costs in blue and utility costs in green. For both cities we can add the corresponding percents to find the total percent of salary that Kim would budget for housing and utility costs.\n\nFor San Francisco, housing accounts for\n54\n%\nand utilities for\n4\n%\nof the budget. Together they would be\n58\n%\nof Kim's salary.\n\n(\n0.58\n)\n(\n50\n,\n000\n)\n=\n$\n29\n,\n000\n\nFor Los Angeles, housing accounts for\n44\n%\nand utilities for\n6\n%\nof the budget. Together they would be\n50\n%\nof Kim's salary.\n\n(\n0.50\n)\n(\n50\n,\n000\n)\n=\n$\n25\n,\n000\n\nTo determine how much extra Kim would pay in San Francisco, we can subtract these two values.\n\n$\n29\n,\n000\n−\n$\n25\n,\n000\n=\n$\n4000\n\nNOTE: We could also arrive at this answer by subtracting the percents first and then finding this percent of Kim's salary. This method is shown below.\n\n58\n%\n−\n50\n%\n=\n8\n%\n\n(\n0.08\n)\n(\n50\n,\n000\n)\n=\n$\n4000\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' compares the difference in utility costs only and does not include housing costs in the calculation. Also, since utility costs are a higher percentage of the budget in Los Angeles than in San Francisco, Kim would not be paying more in San Francisco for utilities.\n\nChoice 'C' compares the difference in housing costs only and does not include utility costs in the calculation. This is how much more Kim would pay in San Francisco than in Los Angeles for housing costs only.\n\nChoice 'D' averages the two percentage (\n58\n%\nand\n50\n%\n) to\n54\n%\nand then multiplies by\n100\n. This calculation makes no sense.\n\nChoice 'E' takes the difference in percent (\n58\n%\n−\n50\n%\n=\n8\n%\n) and then multiplies by\n100\n. This calculation correctly finds the percentage difference between the two cities but does not use this difference as a percent of salary.",
