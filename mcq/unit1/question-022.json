  "solution": "Choice 'A' is incorrect; this deals with binomial probability since the question asks how many out of 10\nbrush their teeth daily.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; this deals with sample means since the number of cavities recorded is measured.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct; this deals with a yes or no answer and records the percentage who brush their teeth daily.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; this selection deals with geometric probability where the variable of interest is number of trials until success.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; while a sample size of 10\nfor sample proportions is certainly not ideal, having a sample this small does not mean we are no longer dealing with sample proportions.",
