  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe Bar Chart is a visual representation of a Categorical Variable. In this case, the Categorical Variable would be the children's favorite tv show. The height of the bar corresponds to the percent of children that answered the tv show.\n\nBluey was selected 40%\nof the time, while Bubble Guppies was selected 25%\nof the time. Therefore, they account for 65%\nof the data, which is more than half.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Bubble Guppies relative frequency is less than Paw Patrol, so Bubble Guppies was not selected more than Paw Patrol.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The percentages do add up to be\n100\n%\n, which makes the table valid.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Bluey was only selected\n40\n%\n, which means the other two add to be\n60\n%\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. The researcher used the shows on their site, therefore he does not need to offer an \"Other Category\".",
