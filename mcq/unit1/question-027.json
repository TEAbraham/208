  "solution": "Remember: the prompt asks us to find the choice that is not supported by the table.\n\nThe table above is an example of a frequency table , but the frequencies are given as relative frequencies instead of counts. It is important to note that percentages, relative frequencies, and rates all give the same information as proportions.\n\nThe table given is the breakdown for the background of the golfers in the field. European golfers make up 15 % 15 % of the field, where as Asian golfers make up 8 % 8 % of the field. Since half of 15 % 15 % is 7.5 % 7.5 % , Asian golfer make up more than half of the European golfers, not less than.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
