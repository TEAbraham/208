  "solution": "The bars of a histogram should be of equal width to most fairly and accurately display the data.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; histograms deal only with quantitative data, while bar graphs look similar to histograms but deal only with categorical data.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; histograms need a minimum of 5\nbars.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; a histogram can be constructed for any shape of data.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; outliers will not be plotted separately on a histogram; only a modified boxplot will plot outliers separately.",
