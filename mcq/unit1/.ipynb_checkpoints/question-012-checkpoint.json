",
  "distractor_explanations": {
    "B": "<strong>Choice 'B'</strong> is incorrect.  Since height is a number that will change from one person to another, it is considered a variable. ",
    "C": "<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is incorrect. Student's favorite class is a value that could change from student to student, therefore it is a variable. ",
    "D": "<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is incorrect. Amount of sleep is a numeric value that will change from one person to another, it is also considered a variable. ",
    "E": "<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is incorrect. Since not everyone's eye color is the same, eye color is also a variable."
