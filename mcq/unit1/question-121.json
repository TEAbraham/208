  "question_text": "A car dealership is having a big promotion where customers who purchase a car can spin a spinner to determine how much of a discount they will get off the purchase price.  Discounts range from $\\$500$ to $\\$2500$ . The spinner is shown below and all wedges on the spinner are equal in area. Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved. If a boxplot was created to display the distribution of discount amounts, what would the boxplot reveal about the shape of the distribution?",
