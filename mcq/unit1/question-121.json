  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "A car dealership is having a big promotion where customers who purchase a car can spin a spinner to determine how much of a discount they will get off the purchase price. Discounts range from $\\$500$ to $\\$2500$.\nThe spinner is shown below and all wedges on the spinner are equal in area.\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved.\nIf a boxplot was created to display the distribution of discount amounts, what would the boxplot reveal about the shape of the distribution?",
