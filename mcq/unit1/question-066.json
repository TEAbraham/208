  "solution": "The dotplot shows a clear outlier at size\n10\n. When an outlier is observed, we cannot immediately dismiss it. Instead, we should consider what might have made it happen. In some cases, a subject doesn't follow directions or answers incorrectly.\n\nIn other cases, there was a typo in data entry. And sometimes, the value really did happen and this observation needs to be examined more carefully.\n\nIn this case, the most likely explanation is that the shoe size of\n10\nreally was a shoe size of\n1\nlike three of the other girls in the group.",
