  "solution": "Remember: we're asked to identify a reason that might cause us to suspect that the distribution of salaries at this company is not approximately normal.\n\nWe are told the mean salary is $\\$58{,}020$ with a standard deviation of $\\$19{,}694$. If the salaries were normally distributed, an individual making $\\$140{,}396$ would have a $z$-score of:\n\n$$ z = \\dfrac{140{,}396 - 58{,}020}{19{,}694}$$\n$$z = 4.18279$$\n\nThis high $z$-score of $z = 4.18279$ corresponds to a percentile of $99.99$, which is higher than the stated $95$.\n\nThis statement then, is contradictory to what we would expect of a normal distribution and gives us some reason to doubt the distribution is approximately normal.\n\nTherefore, Choice 'B' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. In a normal distribution, the value at the $95^\\text{th}\\text{ percentile}$ is farther away from the mean than the value of the $25^\\text{th}\\text{ percentile}$. We would expect this statement to be true in a normal distribution and it is true in this situation. Therefore, it does not lead us to suspect the distribution is not normal.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. If we assume the distribution to be normal with a mean of $\\$58{,}020$ and standard deviation of $\\$19{,}694$, then the $95^\\text{th}\\text{ percentile}$ would correspond with a value of about $\\$90{,}414$. This statement is false about the normal distribution and therefore cannot lead us to believe the distribution of salaries is not approximately normal.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. If we assume the distribution to be normal with a mean of $\\$58{,}020$ and standard deviation of $\\$19{,}694$, then the $25^\\text{th}\\text{ percentile}$ would correspond with a value of $\\$44{,}737$ which is very close to, but still greater than the given value of $\\$44{,}375$. This is a false statement about the normal distribution.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect.",
