  "solution": "The $z$-table shows lower tail probabilities associated with $z$-scores. We are given a lower tail probability of $0.1515$.\n\nLook for this value in the table.\n\nYou will find it in the row labeled $-1.0$ and in the column labeled $0.03$. Put these two values together to get a $z$-score of $-1.03$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. A $z$-score of $-1.30$ corresponds with a lower tail probability of $0.0968$.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. A $z$-score of $-1.00$ corresponds with a lower tail probability of $0.1587$. While this probability is close to what is given, it does not represent the best answer.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. A $z$-score of $1.03$ corresponds with a lower tail probability of $0.8485$ or an upper tail probability of $0.1515$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. A $z$-score of $1.30$ corresponds with a lower tail probability of $0.9032$.",
