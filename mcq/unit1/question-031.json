  "solution": "Calculating the marginal (row) totals yields the following, in order from most popular to least popular with these $115\\text{ families}$:\n\nMonopoly (38), Trivial Pursuit (29), Yahtzee (25), and Wii Bowling (23).\n\nAs an example, Monopoly totals are found by adding the following terms:\n\n14+17+7=38\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Monopoly has the highest number of people who enjoy playing it, (38), not Yahtzee (25).\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. Monopoly has the highest number of people who enjoy playing it (38\n), not Wii Bowling (23\n).\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Monopoly has the highest number of people who enjoy playing it (38\n), once again making this selection incorrect.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Monopoly has the highest number of people who enjoy playing it (38\n), not Trivial Pursuit (29\n).",
