  "solution": "The distribution is stated as normal therefore we can use the z-score formula.\n\nIf $x$ is an observation from a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation, the z-score of $x$ is:\n\n$$z=\\dfrac { \\text{x-mean }}{ \\text{standard deviation} } $$\n\n1) Substitute the values into the formula:\n\n$$z=\\dfrac { x-105.9 }{ 7.4 }$$\n\n2) We need to find the z-score for $80$%. This can be done either by using the calculator or table A.\n\nMethod 1: Using the TI-84 calculator:\n\nPress 2nd then Vars to get into the distribution menu. Using the InvNorm function enter:\n\n\n\nArea represents the area to the left. In this case, we want the cutoff for the bottom $80$% so the area would be $0.80$. The mean and standard deviation of a z-score are $0$ and $1$ respectively.\n\nMethod 2 for finding the z-score of $80$%: Using table A:\n\nLook in the middle of the chart look for an entry closest to $0.80$. This is the entry corresponding to a z-score of $0.84$.\n\nSolve for $x$:\n\n$$0.84=\\dfrac { x-105.9 }{ 7.4 } \\\\ (0.84)(7.4)=(\\dfrac { x-105.9 }{ 7.4 } )(7.4)\\\\ (0.84)(7.4)+105.9=x-105.9+105.9\\\\ 0.84(7.4)+105.9=x$$\n\nChoice 'E' is our answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as the z-score of $-0.84$ is the $20$ percentile of the distribution.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect as $-0.80$ is not the z-score for the $80$th percentile.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as $0.20$ was found from taking $100$% minus $80$%.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect as $0.80$ represents the $80$th percentile and not the z-score for $80$ percent.",
