  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "We first need to determine the frequency (or count) of individuals who selected each choice. We know that\n250\nresponses were received. Therefore, to find the frequency of a response, we simply take the corresponding percentage of\n250\n.\n\nSince\n34\n%\nof indviduals said \"fries\",\n(\n0.34\n)\n(\n250\n)\nor\n85\nindividuals said \"fries\".\n\nSince\n16\n%\nof indviduals said \"cole slaw\",\n(\n0.16\n)\n(\n250\n)\nor\n40\nindividuals said \"cole slaw\".\n\nSince\n24\n%\nof indviduals said \"chips\",\n(\n0.24\n)\n(\n250\n)\nor\n60\nindividuals said \"chips\".\n\nSince\n20\n%\nof indviduals said \"onion rings\",\n(\n0.20\n)\n(\n250\n)\nor\n50\nindividuals said \"onion rings\".\n\nThen\n85\n+\n40\n+\n60\n+\n50\nor\n235\nindividuals said either \"fries\", \"cole slaw\", \"chips\" or \"onion rings\". The rest said \"salad\". Since there were a total of\n250\nresponses, this means that\n250\nâˆ’\n235\nor\n15\nsaid \"salad\".\n\nWe next need to find the graph that correctly represents these frequencies. The graph in Choice 'D' does so! Notice that the blue bar that represents \"fries\", matches up with a frequency on the horizontal axis that is somewhere between\n50\nand\n100\n. It looks closer to\n100\nand could in fact be\n85\n. Although it may be more difficult to establish the frequencies related to the other side dish choices from this graph, we can at least notice that the most frequent response (as noted by the length of the corresponding bar) was for \"fries\", followed by \"chips\", then \"onion rings\", then \"cole slaw\" then \"salad\". This corresponds to the frequencies that we calculated. Additionally, since each of the other possible answer choices has some flaw, it must be true that Choice 'D' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This graph displays the relative frequency of each response rather than the actual frequency of each response.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This graphs displays the percentages as actual frequencies. The percent would only equal the actual frequency if there were exactly\n100\nobservations.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This graph provides correct frequencies, but forgets to include \"salad\" as one of the choices.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This graph is a pie chart. A pie chart does not display frequencies. Rather, it displays relative frequencies and can be used to determine what proportion of responses fell into each category. Furthermore, this pie chart is incorrect because it reverses the proportion of those who said \"fries\" with those who said \"cole slaw\" giving the false impression that \"cole slaw\" was the most popular response.",
