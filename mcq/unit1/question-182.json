  "solution": "Data sets $A$ and $B$ have the same standard deviation.\n\nThe standard deviation can be thought of as the average or typical distance from the mean. Below are the steps on how to find the exact standard deviation for data set $A$.\n\nData set A:\n\nFirst find the mean.\n\nMean=\n(1+2+3+4+5)\n5\n=3\n\nThen, find the distance each value is from the mean, square it, and add these terms up:\n\n(1−3)2+(2−3)2+(3−3)2+(4−3)2+(5−3)2=4+1+0+4+1=10\n\nNot that distance must be positive. This is why the values are squared.\n\nThe find the average of typical distance of the sum square, divide this by:\n\n(n−1)\n\n...where n\nis the number of observations.\n\n10\n5\n−\n1\n=\n10\n4\n=\n2.5\n\nThis value is the variance. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance.\n\n√\n2.5\n=\n1.5811\n\nThe intent of the question is not to make one calculate the standard deviation by hand for each of the data sets. Rather, one should be able to see if observations are generally close to the mean of the data set (distance wise) resulting in a small standard deviation, or far from the mean of the data set (distance wise) resulting in a large standard deviation.\n\nOne can see that the numbers of data sets\nA\nand\nB\nare only\n0\n,\n1\n, or\n2\n units\nfrom their respective means. However, data sets\nC\nand\nD\nhave values\n5\n units\naway from their respective means.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
