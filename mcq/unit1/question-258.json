  "question_text": "The $5$ -number summary for a certain distribution is as follows: $$28$$ $$53$$ $$75$$ $$97$$ $$122$$ The mean of the distribution is $75.10$ and the standard deviation is $31.27$ .  Assume $n\\ge 100$ . Based upon this information, is the distribution approximately normal?  Why or why not?",

      "letter": "B",
      "text": "Yes, because the values in the 5 5 -number summary are completely symmetric around the mean."

    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Yes, because approximately 50 % 50 % of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean.  This is what would be expected in a normal distribution."

      "letter": "D",
      "text": "No, because 100 % 100 % of the data falls within 2 2 standard deviations of the mean.  In a normal distribution, the spread of data would be greater."
