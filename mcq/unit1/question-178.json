  "solution": "To evaluate this question, we need to find the correct statement given the boxplots.\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect, as the IQR (Q3-Q1) for the boys is\n77\n, compared to the girls', which is\n157\n.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect, as the range for the boys (max-min) is\n216\n, compared to the girls', which is\n381\n.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as it states there are\n99\nboys and\n99\ngirls.\n\nJust to note: If the number of values are not given, you cannot determine how many individual data points there are in a boxplot.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect, as Q3 of the boys is less than the median of the girls.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct, as Q3 of the boys is less than the median of the girls.",
