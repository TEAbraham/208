Barbara always buys Florida Gold scratch-off tickets, and Pauline always buys Lotsa Cash scratch-off tickets. They have kept track of their number of winning tickets each month. Below are the results of the number of tickets that have been winners each month during the $12\\text{ months}$ of their record-keeping.
