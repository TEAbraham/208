In golf, par is determined by the number of strokes a golfer without advantage (or handicap, as it is termed) is expected to take on a given hole. The dot plots shown above are for two groups of golfers on a par $3$ course. The top dot plot is a summary of the total scores for $9\\text{ holes}$ by $16$ inexperienced golfers, and the bottom dot plot is a summary of the total scores on the same course for $16$ experienced golfers. If the data for the two sets of golfers were combined and a new dot plot were created using the same scaling as the original two dot plots, then",
