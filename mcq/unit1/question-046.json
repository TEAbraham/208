  "solution": "Eye color is a categorical variable and trying to describe the shape of the distribution is completely inappropriate.\n\nBased on how the eye colors were put in order along the horizontal axis, the graph might appear to be skewed right.\n\nHowever, if we reversed the order in which the eye colors were listed, the graph would appear to be skewed to the left!",
