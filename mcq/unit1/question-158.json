  "question_text": "For several months now, Wally has been using a fitness tracker to keep track of how many steps he takes each day.  From data that he has collected, he calculated the $5$ -number summary to be: $\\text{Min}:  3190$ $\\text{Q1}:  6423$ $\\text{Med}:  7807$ $\\text{Q3}:  9672$ $\\text{Max}:  17210$ Wally wants to make a boxplot so that he can determine the shape of the distribution.  Unfortunately, he walked $17210$ steps today and is too tired to create the boxplot!  Wanda tells Wally not to worry.  She can determine the shape of the distribution from the $5$ -number summary using all the data available. What would Wanda tell Wally?",
