From data that he has collected, he calculated the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span>-number summary to be:    </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\text{Min}:  3190$</span><br><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\text{Q1}:  6423$</span><br><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\text{Med}:  7807$</span><br><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\text{Q3}:  9672$</span><br><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\text{Max}:  17210$</span>  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Wally wants to make a boxplot so that he can determine the shape of the distribution.  Unfortunately, he walked <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$17210$</span> steps today and is too tired to create the boxplot!  Wanda tells Wally not to worry.  She can determine the shape of the distribution from the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span>-number summary using all the data available.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">What would Wanda tell Wally?</div>",
