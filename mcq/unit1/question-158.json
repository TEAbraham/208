  "question_text": "For several months now, Wally has been using a fitness tracker to keep track of how many steps he takes each day. From data that he has collected, he calculated the $5$-number summary to be:<br>$\\text{Min}: 3190$\n$\\text{Q1}: 6423$\n$\\text{Med}: 7807$\n$\\text{Q3}: 9672$\n$\\text{Max}: 17210$<br>Wally wants to make a boxplot so that he can determine the shape of the distribution. Unfortunately, he walked $17210$ steps today and is too tired to create the boxplot! Wanda tells Wally not to worry. She can determine the shape of the distribution from the $5$-number summary using all the data available.<br>What would Wanda tell Wally?",
