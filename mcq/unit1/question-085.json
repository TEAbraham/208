  "solution": "Statements I and II are incorrect; the former deals with the binomial distribution, and each uses “yes” or “no” answers to deal with proportions.\n\nStatement III is correct; this deals with sample means, where the answer to the survey is a number and not a “yes” or “no” answer.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
