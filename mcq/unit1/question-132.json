  "solution": "The 1.5 IQR rule says that a potential outlier would be at least 1.5 IQRs below the first quartile or at least 1.5 IQRs above the third quartile. Calculate the IQR by doing Q3 - Q1.\n\nThe IQR is $28$ for @Chloe, $14$ for @Cylie, and $58$ for @Cendall.\n\nSo 1.5 IQR is $42$ for @Chloe, $21$ for @Cylie, and $87$ for @Cendall.\n\nFor @Chloe an outlier would be below $12 (54 - 42)$ or above $124 (82 + 42)$. For @Cylie an outlier would be below $56$ or above $112$. For @Cendall an outlier would be below $50$ or above $182$.\n\nTherefore, @Cylie has a minimum of $45$ which is a potential outlier and @Cendall has a maximum of $256$, which is also a potential outlier.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect because both the minimum and maximum for @Chloe are within 1.5 IQRs of Q1 and Q3, respectively, so there are no outliers.\n\nChoice ‘B’ is incorrect because @Cendall also has a potential outlier.\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect because @Cylie also has a potential outlier.\n\nChoice ‘E’ because both @Cylie and @Cendall have potential outliers.",
