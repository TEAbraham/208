Suppose the tallest player on this team leaves but is replaced by a $7$-feet-tall player.<br>Which of the following measures are guaranteed to change, and how so?",

  "solution": "The mean must be somewhere between $5\\text{ feet}$ $8\\text{ inches}$ and $6\\text{ feet}$ $10\\text{ inches}$ before the $7$-feet-tall player was added.\n\nWith the highest value now being further from the mean, the standard deviation increases. Remember, the standard deviation is known as the average or typical distance from the mean.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A', 'B', and 'C' are incorrect; these measures will not change. The interquartile range (Q3-Q1) will not change unless many of the observations are at $6\\text{ foot}$ $10\\text{ inches}$. Same with the median and mode.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; the mean will increase, not decrease.",
