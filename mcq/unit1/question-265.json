  "solution": "Use the standard normal table to determine the first percentile is $2.33$ standard deviations below the mean.\n\nTo find the thinnest, solve the following equation:\n\n$$-2.33 =\\dfrac{ (x-0.5)}{0.03}$$\n\n$$x = 0.43$$\n\nUse the standard normal table to determine the $99^\\text{th}$ percentile is $2.33$ standard deviations above the mean.\n\nTo find the thickest, solve the following equation:\n\n$$2.33 =\\dfrac{ (x-0.5)}{0.03}$$\n\n$$x = 0.57$$\n\nThus, the range is $0.43$ to $0.57$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
