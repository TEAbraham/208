  "question_text": "During the summer months, there is often a long wait to ride a popular roller coaster at the Super Fun Amusement Park.\nOne summer day, Jamie waited $29\\text{ minutes}$ to ride the roller coaster, which is the quartile $1\\text{ value}$ for wait times. A few days later Jessie waited $38\\text{ minutes}$, which is at the $70^{th}\\text{ percentile}$ for wait times. Assuming the distribution of wait times is roughly normal, what is the approximate mean wait time to ride this roller coaster during the summer months?",
