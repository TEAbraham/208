  "solution": "We do not know either the mean or standard deviation for the distribution of wait times, but we do know the distribution is normal. Therefore, we can use the $z$-score formula and set up a system of equations. The $z$-score formula is:\n\n$$z=\\dfrac { x-\\mu }{ \\sigma }$$\n\n...where $x$ is the value of the observation.\n\n$\\mu $ is the mean of the distribution (of wait times) and $\\sigma $ is the standard deviation of the distribution (of wait times).\n\nTo fill in this formula, we need to find the $z$-scores associated with quartile $1$ and the $70^{th}\\text{ percentile}$. The quartile $1$ value is also the value at the $25^{th}\\text{ percentile}$. That means that $25\\%$ of the observations are less than quartile $1$ and the area to the left of its corresponding $z$-score is $0.25$.\n\nWe can easily find this $z$-score by using the TI83/84 calculator's invnorm function. The invnorm function provides the $z$-score that corresponds to a given area to the left. The syntax is: invnorm(area to the left).\n\nTo find the $z$-score associated with quartile $1$:\n\nPress 2nd\nPress VARS (DISTR)\nChoose 3 (invnorm)\nEnter 0.25\nPress Enter\n\nThe calculator will return the $z$-score of $-0.674$.\n\nNOTE: We can also find a $z$-score using the $z$-table that is provided with the AP Exam. The $z$-table identifies lower tail probabilities associated with specific $z$-scores (or areas to the left of specific $z$-scores). Look in the table to try to find an area of $0.25$. This value cannot be found in the table but we know that $0.25$ falls between $0.2514$ and $0.2483$ which are values that are found in the $z$-table.\n\nTo find the $z$-score associated with $0.2514$, note that this value is located at the intersection of the row labeled $-0.6$ and the column labeled $0.07$. Put these values together and we have $z = -0.67$ corresponding with a lower tail probability of $0.2514$.\n\nIn the same way, we can note that a lower tail probability of $0.2483$ corresponds with a $z$-score of $z = -0.68$. Therefore, the $z$-score that corresponds with a lower tail probability of $0.25$ (the $25^{th}\\text{ percentile}$ or Quartile $1$ value) is somewhere between $-0.67$ and $-0.68$.\n\nFind the $z$-score associated with the $70^{th}\\text{ percentile}$ in the same way, but identify the area to the left as being $0.70$. The corresponding $z$-score is found to be $0.524$.\n\nNOTE: If using the $z$-table, the $z$-score that corresponds to the $70^{th}\\text{ percentile}$ can be found to be between $0.52$ and $0.53$. While the calculations that follow use the slightly more accurate $z$-scores from the calculator, the procedure can also be followed using $z$-scores from the table. Intermediate answers may vary slightly due to rounding, but the final answer will be the same.\n\nNow we can fill in the $z$-score formula twice - once for each value.\n\nFor the quartile I value:\n\n$$-0.674=\\dfrac { 29-\\mu }{ \\sigma } $$\n\n$$ -0.674\\sigma =29-\\mu$$\n\nNote that the second equation above is found by multiplying both sides of the original equation by $\\sigma $.\n\nFor the $70^{th}\\text{ percentile}$ value:\n\n$$0.524=\\dfrac { 38-\\mu }{ \\sigma } $$\n\n$$ 0.524\\sigma =38-\\mu$$\n\nAgain, the second equation above is found by multiplying both sides of the original equation by $\\sigma $.\n\nWe now have a system of equations:\n\n$$-0.674\\sigma = 29-\\mu$$\n\n$$0.524\\sigma = 38-\\mu$$\n\nSolve the system by multiplying both sides of the first equation by $-1$ and then adding it to the second equation in order to eliminate $\\mu$. We can then solve for the standard deviation, $\\sigma $:\n\n$$0.674\\sigma =-29+\\mu$$\n\n$$0.524\\sigma =38-\\mu$$\n\n$$1.198\\sigma =9$$\n\n$$ \\sigma =7.51$$\n\nNow that we know $\\sigma = 7.51$, we can substitute this value back into one of the equations in order to find $\\mu$.\n\n$$0.674\\sigma =-29+\\mu $$\n\n$$\\left( 0.674 \\right) \\left( 7.51 \\right) =-29+\\mu $$\n\n$$ \\mu =34.06$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. It uses the following set-up:\n\n$$\\dfrac { 38 }{ 70 } =\\dfrac { \\mu }{ 50 } $$\n\nThis equation assumes that the mean is at the $50^{th}\\text{ percentile}$ (which is correct in the case of a normal distribution), but also assumes a proportional relationship between percentiles. This second assumption is incorrect.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. We cannot simply average the two wait times that are provided in order to find the mean.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and probably represents an attempt at guessing.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It makes the same mistake as in Choice 'A' and uses the following incorrect set-up:\n\n$$\\dfrac { 29 }{ 25 } =\\dfrac { \\mu }{ 50 }$$",
