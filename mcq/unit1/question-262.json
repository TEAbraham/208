A few days later Jessie waited <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$38\\text{ minutes}$</span>, which is at the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$70^{th}\\text{ percentile}$</span> for wait times.  Assuming the distribution of wait times is roughly normal, what is the approximate mean wait time to ride this roller coaster during the summer months?   </div>",
