It is known that the standard deviation of the amount of candy that will be dispensed from this machine is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.08$</span> oz and that the amount dispensed follows a normal distribution. We need to calibrate the machine so that the mean amount dispensed will be less than the advertised amount no more than <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2\\%$</span> of the time.â€‹  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What should we calibrate the mean to be?</div>",
