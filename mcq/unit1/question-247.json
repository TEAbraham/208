  "question_text": "A candy machine dispenses small chocolate candies and claims that $1$ oz is dispensed each time. It is known that the standard deviation of the amount of candy that will be dispensed from this machine is $0.08$ oz and that the amount dispensed follows a normal distribution. We need to calibrate the machine so that the mean amount dispensed will be less than the advertised amount no more than $2\\%$ of the time.<br>What should we calibrate the mean to be?",
