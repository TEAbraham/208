  "question_text": "Suppose Jane is interested in the total number of points scored in Division I NCAA college basketball games. She takes a look at several years of data and finds this distribution is approximately normal with a mean of $154\\text{ points}$ and a standard deviation of $9\\text{ points}$.<br>Would it be surprising to find a game where the total number of points scored is over $185$?",

  "solution": "Find the $z$-score that represents a score that adds to up $185$ by plugging in the mean and standard deviation to the standard score equation:\n\n$$\\dfrac{(185-154)}{9} = 3.44$$\n\nUse the standard normal table to find,\n\n$$P(z>3.44) = 1-0.9997 = 0.0003$$\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
