  "solution": "While knowing the outliers of a distribution can help us understand the spread of a distribution, one outlier by itself does not tell us much.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the range is the difference between the smallest and largest values and is a measure of spread.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the interquartile range is the difference between the first and third quartile.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' are incorrect; boxplots graphically represent the numbers from a five-number summary, which include the following: { minimum, $Q1$, Median, $Q3$, maximum }. These measures, as mentioned in Choices 'A' and 'B' explain the spread of the data.",
