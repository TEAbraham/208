  "solution": "The heavier orange added must increase mean.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the median might change if the $5$th and $6$th heaviest oranges are different weights. However, if they are the same weight, the median would not change.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the mode is the value that occurs the most frequently; therefore, the mode would not change with the heavier orange added.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the interquartile range might change, but if the 7th and 8th heaviest oranges are the same weight, the IQR will not change.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; the first quartile might change, but if the 2nd and 3rd heaviest oranges weigh the same, the first quartile will not change.",
