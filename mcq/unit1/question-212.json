  "solution": "Using process of elimination, we can eliminate Choices 'D' and 'E' as we are looking for the cutoff for the bottom $32\\%$. The mean represents $50\\%$ in a normal distribution which indicates the weight of the car in the $32$ percentile is below $2970\\text{ pounds}$.\n\nThe easiest way to solve this problem is to use the graphing calculator: Press 2nd then Vars to get into the Distribution menu. Using the InvNorm function enter:\n\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nArea represents the area to the left. In this case, we want the cutoff for the bottom $32\\%$ so the area would be $0.32$. The mean and standard deviation are given.\n\nWhen we run this in our calculator, we get $\\bf 2577.2\\text{ pounds}$\n\nChoice 'C' is our answer.\n\nAlternative Method\n\nA second approach to solving this would be to use the z-score formula: If $x$ is an observation from a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation, the z-score of $x$ is\n\n$$z=\\dfrac { \\text{x-mean }}{ \\text{standard deviation} }$$\n\nNow we need to find the z-score for $32\\%$ either using Table A or a graphing calculator.\n\nUsing the TI-84 graphing calculator: Press 2nd then Vars to get into the Distribution menu. Using the InvNorm function enter:\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved.\n\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved.\n\nArea represents the area to the left. In this case, we want the cutoff for the bottom 32% so the area would be 0.87.\n\nThe mean, μ, is represented by 0 and the standard deviation,σ, is represented by 1 because we have standardized the variable x.\n\nUsing table A: Look in the middle of the chart look for an entry closest to 0.32. It is 0.3192. This is the entry corresponding to z ≈−0.47.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\n−0.468=\nx−2970\n840\n\nSolve for x\n:\n\n−0.468=\nx−2970\n840\n\n(−0.468)(840)=(\nx−2970\n840\n)(840)\n\n−393.12=x−2970\n\n2576.88=x\n\n2576.88\nis an approximate value as the z-score was rounded. The closest value is Choice 'C'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as 3.2%\nwas used for the area instead of 32%\n.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect as this is the value for one standard deviation below the mean.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect as the z-score used here was 0.32\ninstead of −0.47\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect as 68%\nwas chosen for the area.",
