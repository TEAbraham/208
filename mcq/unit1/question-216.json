  "solution": "If the original mean is multiplied by $2$ with $10$ added to the result, then the new mean is $(25)(2)+10 = 60$.\n\nThe standard deviation is unaffected by the addition of a constant, but it is affected by multiplying a constant. The new standard deviation is ($5) \\cdot (2) = 10$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
