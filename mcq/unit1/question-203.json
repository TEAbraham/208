  "solution": "The figure shows an area between one standard deviation below the mean and two standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFirst figure out the value for one standard deviation below the mean:\n\n$$\\mu -\\sigma =42000-3000=39000 \\ \\text{ miles}$$\n\nWe can eliminate Choices 'A' and 'B'.\n\nNext, figure out the value for two standard deviations above the mean:\n\n$$\\mu +2\\sigma =42000+(2)(3000)=48000 \\ \\text{ miles}$$\n\nChoices 'C' and 'E' can be eliminated.\n\nChoice 'D' is our answer.",
