  "solution": "A variable is a specific characteristic of an individual. The value or description of any particular variable however, can be different for different individuals.\n\nIn the case of this team roster, the characteristics being identified are the individual's position, height and weight.\n\nChoice 'D' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. The 5 players are the individuals for which the different variables are being recorded.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. Position is one specific (categorical) variable being recorded. The different positions represent different \"values\" or descriptions of that variable.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Height and weight are two specific (quantitative) variables being recorded. The different heights and different weights represent different values of these two variables. NOTE: Height is generally considered a quantitative variable since it is a quantity that can be measured or counted (in this case in both feet and inches). From a statistical standpoint however, it would be much more convenient to convert the heights into inches alone.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Player name would not be considered a variable here since the names are simply used to identify the individuals on the roster. We are not looking to categorize the individuals based upon their name, but rather to describe these individuals using the variables of position, height, and weight.",
