A transportation safety group was interested in knowing the average odometer reading of cars that are currently being driven and decided to investigate.  To gather data, they surveyed a random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$80\\text{ licensed drivers}$</span>.  Each driver was asked to report the odometer reading on the car that they drive the most.  Results of the survey are shown in the boxplot below.  </div><div class=\"u-display_flex u-justify-content_center\"><div class=\"u-display_flex u-justify-content_center u-mar-b_2\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" data-prefix=\"fas\" data-icon=\"spinner\" class=\"svg-inline--fa fa-spinner fa-pulse fa-fw fa-2x a-icon content-inherit\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M304 48a48 48 0 1 0 -96 0 48 48 0 1 0 96 0zm0 416a48 48 0 1 0 -96 0 48 48 0 1 0 96 0zM48 304a48 48 0 1 0 0-96 48 48 0 1 0 0 96zm464-48a48 48 0 1 0 -96 0 48 48 0 1 0 96 0zM142.9 437A48 48 0 1 0 75 369.1 48 48 0 1 0 142.9 437zm0-294.2A48 48 0 1 0 75 75a48 48 0 1 0 67.9 67.9zM369.1 437A48 48 0 1 0 437 369.1 48 48 0 1 0 369.1 437z\"></path></svg><label class=\"sr-only\"><progress></progress>Loading question supplement...</label></div></div><div class=\"paragraph\">  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of the following statements is correct?</div>",
