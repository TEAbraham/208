  "question_text": "A car's odometer keeps track of how many miles the car has been driven. A transportation safety group was interested in knowing the average odometer reading of cars that are currently being driven and decided to investigate. To gather data, they surveyed a random sample of $80\\text{ licensed drivers}$. Each driver was asked to report the odometer reading on the car that they drive the most. Results of the survey are shown in the boxplot below.<br>Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved.<br><br>Which of the following statements is correct?",
