  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Suzy has a blog where she discusses how much shoppers can save when buying a store brand product rather than a well-known name brand product.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Recently, Suzy posted that while different types of cereal may cost more or less, the average cost of a box of cereal with a well-known name brand is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\$3.98$</span> while the average cost of a box of cereal with a store brand is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\$3.47$</span>.  Suzy also explained for those who buy one box of cereal a week, over the course of one year, they could save an average of more than <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\$20$</span> by purchasing the store brand over the big name brand.  \"And that's enough to buy at least four large frozen caramel macchiatos with chocolate granola drizzle at your local coffee shop!\"  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Is Suzy correct? Justify your response.</div>",
