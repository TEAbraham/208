  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "Suzy has a blog where she discusses how much shoppers can save when buying a store brand product rather than a well-known name brand product.<br>Recently, Suzy posted that while different types of cereal may cost more or less, the average cost of a box of cereal with a well-known name brand is $\\$3.98$ while the average cost of a box of cereal with a store brand is $\\$3.47$. Suzy also explained for those who buy one box of cereal a week, over the course of one year, they could save an average of more than $\\$20$ by purchasing the store brand over the big name brand. \"And that's enough to buy at least four large frozen caramel macchiatos with chocolate granola drizzle at your local coffee shop!\"<br>Is Suzy correct? Justify your response.",

  "solution": "Since the mean (average) cost for one box of name brand cereal is $\\$3.98$ and the mean cost for one box of store brand cereal is $\\$3.47$, we can find the mean savings on one box of cereal by subtracting.\n\n$$\\$3.98-\\$3.47=\\$0.51$$\n\nThere are 52 weeks in one year, so we can find the mean total amount of savings over the course of one year by multiplying.\n\n($0.51)(52)=$26.52\n\nIn order for $26.52 to cover the cost of four large frozen caramel macchiatos with chocolate granola drizzle, the maximum cost of one large frozen caramel macchiato with chocolate granola drizzle can be no more than:\n\n$26.52\n4\n=$6.63\n\nTherefore, Choice 'C' is the correct answer.\n\nNOTE: While this problem can be approached very logically as outlined above, we could also be much more statistically formal in our approach.\n\nThe cost of one box of name brand cereal is a random variable we could call B. The cost of one box of store brand cereal is also a random variable we could call S\n\nμB=$3.98\n\nμS=$3.47\n\nTo find the mean difference between two random variables, we simply subtract the individual means. Therefore:\n\nμB−S=μB−μS\n\n=$3.98−$3.47\n\n=$0.51\n\nSince we are assuming that an individual would buy one box of cereal each week for one year (or 52\nweeks), we would continue as follows:\n\n52⋅(μB−S)\n\n=52⋅$0.51\n\n=$26.52\n\nIf the cost of one large frozen caramel macchiato with chocolate granola drizzle is $6.63\n(or less), then the cost of four drinks would be 4⋅($6.63)\n(or less). Therefore, the mean annual savings would be enough to cover the cost of 4 drinks\n.\n\nAgain, Choice 'C' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because\n$\n0.51\nis the average savings on buying only one box of store brand cereal.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect since\n$\n6.12\nis the average savings for buying one box of store brand cereal each month for\n12\n months\n.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and may represent a pure guess. If each large frozen caramel macchiato with chocolate granola drizzle costs\n$\n8.84\n, then the mean annual savings needed to cover the cost of four drinks would be\n(\n4\n)\n(\n$\n8.84\n)\n=\n$\n35.36\n, which is more than the true mean annual savings of\n$\n26.52\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because\n$\n180.44\nis the average cost of buying one box of store brand cereal each week for\n52\nweeks.",
