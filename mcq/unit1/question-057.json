  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The ages of employees at the tech start-up are summarized in a cumulative relative frequency graph , or Ogive . A cumulative graph represents the number or proportion of a data set less than or equal to a given number. You can find the proportion of data points in a certain interval by finding the percent for the upper bound and the percent for the lower bound and subtracting the two values.\n\nWhen looking at this ogive, to find the proportion of employees younger than 40 40 , follow the horizontal axis until you get to 40 40 years old. Then move vertically until you hit the line graph, and make a right angle to the vertical axis. You find the proportion of employees 40 40 years old or younger is approximately 0.52 0.52 , which is over half of the employees.\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.",
