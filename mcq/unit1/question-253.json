  "question_text": "Zack takes the SAT, and his best friend, Nick, takes the ACT.<br>Zack’s SAT Math score is $680$, and Nick’s ACT Math score is $27$. SAT Math scores in the county are normally distributed with a mean of $500$ and a standard deviation of $100$. ACT Math scores in the county are also normally distributed but with a mean of $18$ and a standard deviation of $6$.<br>Assuming that both tests measure the same kind of ability, who has scored better relative to their peers?",

  "solution": "We can find the relative ranking by converting each score to standardized $z$-scores using:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{(X-\\mu)}{\\sigma}$$\n\n...where $z$ is the $z$-score, $X$ is the sample, $\\mu$ is the population mean, and $\\sigma$ is the population standard deviation.\n\nZack’s score = $\\dfrac{(680-500)}{100} = 1.8$\n\nNick’s score = $\\dfrac{(27-18)}{6} = 1.5$\n\nThus, Zack’s score is better.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; raw scores cannot be validly compared.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; it is stated that the two tests measure the same kind of ability.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; is disproven by the work shown above in answer (B).\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; it is valid to compare the performance on the two tests because they measure the same kind of ability.",
