The designers of the experiment used each battery for a fixed task and determined how many trials the battery could perform before it died.<br>The results are presented in the boxplots below.<br>Created for Albert.io.

  "solution": "Based on the boxplots, brand-name batteries have a 3rd quartile of about\n200\n trials\n.\n\nTherefore, about\n150\n⋅\n0.25\n=\n37.5\nof these batteries last more than\n200\n trials\n.\n\nGeneric batteries have a first quartile of about\n200\n trials\n.\n\nTherefore, about\n150\n×\n0.75\n=\n112.5\nof these batteries last more than\n200\n trials\n.\n\n37.5\n+\n112.5\n=\n150\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
