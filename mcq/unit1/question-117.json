  "solution": "The first quartile is not measured at the center of the box; it is measured at the beginning of the first box. The first quartile is shown in red in the image below.\n\nThe first quartile for beef and other meat is somewhere near $140$, and poultry is near $105$.\n\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nTherefore, none of the meats has a first quartile of $125$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
