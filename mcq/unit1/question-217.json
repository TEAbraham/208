  "solution": "Histograms (along with stemplots and normal probability plots) do a good job of displaying and determining normality.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. A pie chart only displays categorical data.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. A scatterplot displays two variable data.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. A box does display single variable, quantitative data, but does a relatively poor job of determining normality.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. A bar graph only displays categorical data.",
