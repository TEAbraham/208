  "solution": "The quantitative data above has been summarized into a histogram. In a histogram, the height of each bar shows the number of observations in that interval. To find the number of observations in an interval, you have to add up the heights.\n\nIn our case, since we want the number of tips less than\n$\n6\n, we will find the height of the first three intervals. The first interval,\n$\n0\nto\n$\n2\n, has\n10\nobservations. The second interval\n$\n2\nto\n$\n4\n, has\n15\nobservations. And the third interval,\n$\n4\nto\n$\n6\n, has\n5\nobservations. Therefore, the total amount of tips less than\n$\n6\nis\n10\n+\n15\n+\n5\n=\n30\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
