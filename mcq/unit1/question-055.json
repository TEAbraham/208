  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe quantitative data above has been summarized into a histogram. In a histogram, the height of each bar shows the number of observations in that interval. To find the number of observations in an interval, you have to add up the heights.\n\nIn our case, since we want the number of tips less than\n$\n6\n, we will find the height of the first three intervals. The first interval,\n$\n0\nto\n$\n2\n, has\n10\nobservations. The second interval\n$\n2\nto\n$\n4\n, has\n15\nobservations. And the third interval,\n$\n4\nto\n$\n6\n, has\n5\nobservations. Therefore, the total amount of tips less than\n$\n6\nis\n10\n+\n15\n+\n5\n=\n30\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. There are\n5\ntips in the interval from\n$\n4\nto\n$\n6\n, but that does not include ALL the tips less than\n$\n6\n.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. There are\n9\ntips that are greater than\n$\n6\n, not less than.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. There are\n10\ntips in the interval from\n$\n0\nto\n$\n2\n, but that still does not account for all the tips.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. There are\n20\ntips in the interval from\n$\n2\nto\n$\n6\n, but that still does not account for all the tips.",
