  "solution": "The data above is summarized in a relative table that takes the favorite activity and gives the relative frequency of the responses. The relative frequency represent the proportion of times the activity was answered, and all the relative frequencies add up to be $1$.\n\nIn order to figure out the amount of people who answered boating as their favorite activity, we need to take the number of people who responded and multiply it by the relative frequency. For example, for boating, we will do the following:\n\n$$\\text{(Number of responders)(Relative Frequency)}$$\n$$150(0.24)$$\n$$=36 \\text{ people}$$\n\nTherefore, $36$ people answered boating as their favorite activity.\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.",
