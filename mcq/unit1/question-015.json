  "solution": "A data set contains information about a certain number of individuals. The data collected on the individuals can be split into one or more variables.\n\nSome variables are Categorical, can easily be put into groups or categories, or Quantitative, which has a numerical value that measures something about the individuals.\n\nIn this case, the individuals are the three cars Steven is researching. He collected data on five variables for each car. The variables can be split into the following categories:\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
