  "question_text": "A high school principal collects some data about students at his school. He uses his student information system to find the grade point average (GPA) of $10$ random students. The GPAs are listed below: $$3.2, 3.7, 4.0, 2.5, 3.1, 3.5, 3.8, 3.0, 2.7, 2.5$$ This gives the principal an average GPA of $3.2$ on a $4$ point scale. Can the principal confidently say that the average GPA of his high school is $3.2$ ?",

      "text": "No, because the median does not equal 3.2 3.2 ."

    {
      "letter": "E",
      "text": "No, because the data will change with a different sample of 10 10 students."
    }
  ],
  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When data is collected randomly, there will always be some variation . Since variation occurs, the conclusions based off that data is often uncertain.\n\nSince the principal only took a sample of size 10 10 , we can safely assume the school is larger than 10 10 students. Therefore, the \"average\" of the 10 10 is uncertain to be the average of the whole school.\n\nThe principal cannot confidently say that the average GPA of the whole school is 3.2 3.2 .\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
