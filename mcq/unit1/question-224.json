This helps motorists be more aware of their speed, but it can also be used to track the speed of vehicles that pass the radar.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">During the two weeks that the sign was in place, the mean speed of all vehicles passing the sign was found to be <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$42.8\\text{ mph}$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Assuming the distribution of speeds was approximately normal and the standard deviation of all vehicles that passed this sign was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5.3\\text{ mph}$</span>, what proportion of cars were traveling more than <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40\\text{ mph}$</span>?</div>",
