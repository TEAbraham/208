The height of an adult female is approximately normally distributed, with a mean of $63.6$ inches and standard deviation $2.5\\text{ inches}$.<br>What would be the approximate height of an adult female with the same standardized score ($z$-score) as an adult male with a height of $70.4\\text{ inches}$?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "To answer this question, you first must calculate the $z$-score of the adult man that has a height of $70.4\\text{ inches}$.\n\n$$z=\\frac { x-\\mu }{ \\sigma } =\\frac { 70.4-69 }{ 2.8 } =0.5$$\n\nThen, you must substitute that $z$-score into the equation for the $z$-score of the woman's and solve for $x$.\n\n$$0.5=\\frac { x-63.6 }{ 2.5 }$$\n\nNow to solve for $x$, multiply both sides by $2.5$ and add $63.6$. Therefore, Choice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is a common wrong answer, and it was reached this way because the $z$-score found in the man's height was $-0.5$.\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; and it was reached this way because the $z$-score found in the man's height was $-5$.\n\nChoice 'D'is incorrect; and it was reached this way because the $z$-score found in the man's height was $5$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; and it was reached this way as the females' average height and standard deviation were accidentally used when finding the z-score for a man's height of $70.4$ inches.",
