  "solution": "Standard deviation represents how far the individual values vary from the mean, or the average distance a value is from the mean. In this case, the smallest standard deviation will be Graph 'B' because there are many more values closer to the mean than further away.\n\nIt might be tempting to say that Graph 'A' has the smallest standard deviation because you think that it is zero. However, in order for the standard deviation to be zero, all of the values have to be the same (meaning no spread), which would be represented by one bar.\n\nThe graph with the largest standard deviation is Graph 'C', as it has many more values further away from the mean than closer to it.\n\nTherefore, to place these in increasing order, it would be\nB\n,\nA\n,\nC\n, or Choice 'D'.",
