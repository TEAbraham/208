  "question_text": "Penguin Pablo's Picnic is a video game where the main character is a penguin living in Antarctica. The goal of the game is to help Pablo eat as many fish as possible, and points are scored for every fish he consumes. Some types of fish are worth more points than others.<br>Assuming scores are normally distributed, what $z$-score is needed to put a player in the $80\\text{th}$ percentile for number of points scored?",

  "solution": "If a player's score is in the $80\\text{th}$ percentile, then that player's score is equal to or better than $80\\%$ of all scores. This means that the probability of any score being less than or equal to this player's score is $0.80$.\n\nThe $z$-table shows the area to the left of the given $z$-score, or the probability of: $z < (\\text{the given }z\\text{-score})$.\n\nSo we are looking for the $z$-score that corresponds with an area of $0.80$ to the left. The closest entry in the $z$-table that corresponds with this is $z = 0.84$.\n\nNOTE: you can also find this answer using the invNorm function on your TI83/84 graphing calculator. This function allows you to identify the area to the left of your desired $z$-score and will provide you with the appropriate $z$-score. The syntax is: invNorm(area to the left).\n\nIn this case you would:\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This gives the $z$-score that corresponds with the $20\\text{th}$ percentile.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This gives the $z$-score that corresponds with approximately the $21\\text{st}$ percentile. We cannot simply take the given percentile and turn it into a decimal. Making the value negative compounds the mistake.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. We cannot assume $z = 0.80$ corresponds with the $80\\text{th}$ percentile.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Percentile values and $z$-score values are not equivalent. The $80\\text{th}$ percentile does not correspond with a $z$-score of $80$.",
