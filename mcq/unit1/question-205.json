  "question_text": "Suppose Jane is interested in the total number of points scored in Division I NCAA college basketball games. She takes a look at several years of data and finds this distribution is approximately normal with a mean of $154\\text{ points}$ and standard deviation of $9\\text{ points}$.<br>Using the empirical rule, what is the probability of finding a random game where the total points scored is $163$ or greater?",

  "solution": "The empirical rule says that if the data is approximately normal, $68\\%$ of the data will be within one standard deviation while $95\\%$ of the data will be within two standard deviations, and $99.7\\%$ of the data will be within three standard deviations of the mean.\n\nThis problem shows the value $163$ exactly one standard deviation above the mean as:\n\n$$\\frac{(163-154)}{9} = 1$$\n\nTherefore, $68\\%$ of games score between $145$ and $163\\text{ points } (\\text{Mean} + 1 \\text{ SD})$.\n\nUsing complementary probabilities, $100\\%-68\\%$ = $32\\%$ of the data must be outside this range. Since the normal distribution is symmetric, $16\\%$ of observations must be less than $145$, and $16\\%$ of observations must be greater than $163$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
