  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The best way to evaluate this question is to go statement by statement and eliminate the incorrect choices.\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; it has the definitions switched. The mean is the numerical average, while the median is the midpoint of a distribution.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the mean and median will be approximately the same in a symmetric distribution\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; since the mean is not resistant, the median is a preferred measure of center when dealing with skewed distributions.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; since the mean is not resistant, the mean will be pulled in the direction of the skewness.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct; the median is resistant to extreme values and skewness, while the mean is not. Therefore, either measure is appropriate for symmetric distributions, but the median is the preferred measure of center when skewness or outliers are present.",
