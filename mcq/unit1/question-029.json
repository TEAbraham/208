  "solution": "The above table puts the respondents into groups by their satisfaction level, therefore representing a categorical variable. A researcher can use the frequency table to make claims about the people who responded to the survey.\n\nIn this case, the researcher claimed that a majority of respondents answered at least \"Satisfied\". This is not true, as \"Satisfied\" and \"Extremely Satisfied\" only account for 47%, which does not represent a majority of the people who responded.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distrators\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Even though \"Satisfied\" has the highest percentage, it does not represent a majority of the respondents.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. \"Satisfied\" and \"Extremely Satisfied\" only add to 47%\n, not 50%\n.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Even though \"Dissatisfied\" and \"Extremely Dissatisfied\" don't add to over 50%\n, \"Neutral\" would not count for \"Satisfied\".\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. 24%\ndid answer Neutral, but this does not affect the amount that chose \"Satisfied\".",
