  "solution": "We are presented with two boxplots demonstrating the 5-number summaries for the years $2011$ and $2010$.\n\nSince the $2011$ median is greater than the $2010$ $ Q1$, the $2011$ histogram center would be to the right of $2010$â€™s.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the left whisker for the $2011$ box plot is very short, so the left side of the resulting histogram would not be left skewed.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the range between the $2010$ median and $Q3$ is very small, and the range between $Q3$ and the maximum is large; the data is skewed right.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the range between the $2010$ median and $Q3$ is significantly smaller than the same range for $2011$. This difference would give the respective histograms a different shape.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; the two distributions have nearly identical values for their respective ranges: about $55$ for $2010$ and about $50$ for $2011$.",
