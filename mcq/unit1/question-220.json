All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nUse either a table of standard normal curve probabilities or your calculator to determine the probability.\n\nUsing the table of standard normal curve probabilities, first look up a $z$-value of $-1.1$, and you will get $0.1357$, which is the area of the standard normal curve from negative infinity to $-1.1$, the left area on the sketch above.\n\nThen look up a $z$-value of $0.6$, and you will get $0.7257$, which is the area from negative infinity to $z = 0.6$. Subtracting these two areas to determine the area of the shaded region yields $0.7257-0.1357 = 0.59$.\n\nIf using a calculator, use the command normalcdf (-1.1,0.6) to get $0.5901$ as the answer.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
