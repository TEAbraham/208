Distances are normally distributed and have a standard deviation of $43\\text{ yards}$.<br>If a $350\\text{ yard}$ drive puts an individual in the top $1\\%$ of all drives, what is the mean of this distribution?",

  "solution": "This problem tests studentsâ€™ ability to use the normal tables and algebra to solve for the mean. Using Table A from your AP Statistics tables, you can find where the $z$-value would be for approximately $0.9900$, which ends up being at $2.3$ and $0.03$ with a $p$-value of $0.9901$.\n\nSet up the following equation and solve for $x$ to get $x = 250$:\n\n$$\\frac{350-x}{43} = 2.33$$\n\n$$350-x=100.19$$\n\n$$-x=-249.81$$\n\n$$x=249.81$$\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
