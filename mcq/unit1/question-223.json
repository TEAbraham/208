  "solution": "Using process of elimination, we can eliminate Choice 'A' * as we are looking for the cutoff for the top $5$%. The mean represents $50\\%$ in a normal distribution which indicates the placement score must be above $450$.\n\nThe easiest way to solve this problem is to use the graphing calculator: Press 2nd then Vars to get into the Distribution menu. Using the InvNorm function enter:\n\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nThe trick in this problem is what to put in for the area. Area represents the area to the left. In this case, we want the cutoff for the top(right) $5$% which means the bottom(left) $95$%. The mean and standard deviation are given.\n\nChoice 'D' would be our answer.\n\nA second approach to solve this would be to use the $z$-score formula: If $x$ is an observation from a normal distribution with a known mean and standard deviation, the $z$-score of $x$ is\n\n$$z=\\dfrac { \\text{x-mean }}{ \\text{standard deviation} }$$\n\nNow we need to find the $z$-score for $95\\%$ either using Table A or a graphing calculator.\n\nUsing the TI-84 graphing calculator: Press 2nd then Vars to get into the Distribution menu. Using the InvNorm function enter:\n\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nArea represents the area to the left. In this case, we want the cutoff for the bottom $95\\%$ so the area would be $0.95$.\n\nThe mean, $\\mu $, is represented by $0$ and the standard deviation,$\\sigma$, is represented by $1$ because we have standardized the variable $x$.\n\nUsing table A: Look in the middle of the chart look for an entry closest to $0.95$. It is between $0.9495$ and $0.9505$. This is the entry corresponding to $z = 1.645$.\n\nSubstitute the values into the formula:\n\n$$1.645=\\dfrac { x-450}{ 50 }$$\n\nSolve for $x$:\n\n$$1.645=\\dfrac { x-450 }{ 50 } \\\\ (1.645)(50)=(\\dfrac { x-450 }{ 50 } )(50)\\\\ 82.25=x-450\\\\ 532.25=x$$\n\nUsing a calculator is much easier.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A is incorrect as the area to the left that was used was $5\\%$ instead of $95$.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect as when this problem was solved out using $z$-scores, the $z$-score used was $.05$ instead of $1.645$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as when this problem was solved out using $z$-scores, the $z$-score used was $0.95$ instead of $1.645$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect as when this problem was solved out using $z$-scores, the $z$-score used was $2$ instead of $1.645$.",
