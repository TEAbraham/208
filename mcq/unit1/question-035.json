  "solution": "A pie chart is the only one of the answer choices that can be used to display categorical data.\n\nThe data collected above measures the frequency of type of instrument, which is a categorical variable.\n\nNo type of distribution where shape can be determined makes sense in this case, as any of the categories (piano, guitar, etc) can be switched around in different order. Therefore, any graph such as a histogram, stemplot, or boxplot could not be used to display the data.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
