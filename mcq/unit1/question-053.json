  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "All the above variables are examples of quantitative variables , which can be described as either discrete or continuous. A discrete quantitative variable takes on a countable number of values with gaps between numbers, whereas continuous quantitative variables can take on infinitely many values no matter the size of the interval.\n\nIn this case, the only one that can use non-countable numbers would be the distance walked in a walk-a-thon. Since distance is a length measurement, there are infinitely many numbers that the distance can take, no matter the interval.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
