  "question_text": "The distribution of heights of $4\\text{-year-old boys}$ in the town of Giganticville is approximately normally distributed with a mean of $78.0$ inches and standard deviation of $4.3\\text{ inches}$.<br>Manute, a $4\\text{-year-old-boy}$ from Giganticville has a height that is $0.23$ standard deviations below the mean. His $4\\text{-year-old-boy}$ neighbor Mugsy is at the $45^\\text{th}$ percentile of the height distribution.<br>What percentile is Manute's height, and how does his height compare to Mugsy's height?",
