  "solution": "The table given in the prompt summarizes the data of two Categorical Variables since the nurse is placing the babies into different groups based off gender and height.\n\nWhen looking at categorical variables, there are many different graphs we can use to visualize the data. Examples of these graphs are pie charts, bar charts, segmented bar charts, and side-by-side bar graphs. This graph allows you to see the counts, or frequencies, of the categories split up into two different categories. Therefore, of the options given above, the side-by-side bar graph is the only acceptable graph.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
