  "solution": "A height $1.2$ standard deviations below the mean corresponds with a $z$-score of $-1.2$ while a height $1.8$ standard deviations above the mean corresponds with a $z$-score of $1.8$. We are looking for $p(-1.2 < z < 1.8)$. The easiest way to do this is to use the normalcdf function on your TI83/84 graphing calculator. The syntax is: normalcdf(lower bound, upper bound, mean, standard deviation). In this case:\n\nEnter 2nd, DISTR,\nChoose normalcdf\nEnter -1.2, 1.8, 0, 1\n\nThe calculator will return the value of about $0.849$.\n\nWe can also find this value using the $z$-table. Remember, the $z$-table always provides probabilities to the left of the given $z$-score. Therefore:\n\n$$p(-1.2 < z < 1.8) = p(z < 1.8) - p(z < -1.2)$$\n\nTo find $p(z < 1.8)$ follow the first column of $z$-values down until you find $1.8$. Move across this row to the first value which corresponds with a $z$-score of $1.80$. The value you find is $0.9641$ and includes the entire area under the curve to the left of a $z$-score of $1.80$.\n\nTo find $p(z < -1.2)$ follow the first column of $z$-values down until you find $-1.2$. Move across this row to the first value which corresponds with a $z$-score of $-1.20$. The value you will find is $0.1151$ which includes the entire area under the curve to left of the $z$-score of $-1.20$.\n\nFinally, $0.9641 - 0.1151 = 0.849$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. It is the complement of the correct answer. That is, it represents $p(z < -1.2 or z > 1.8)$.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. It is an estimate based upon the Empirical Rule, but is not as accurate as Choice 'C'.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This value is $p(z < 1.8)$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This is a case of the Empirical Rule gone bad. Values between $z = -1.2$ and $z = 1.8$ represent a total of $3$ standard deviations. While the Empirical Rule tells us that $99.7\\%$ of observations will be within $3$ standard deviations of the mean, this only applies when the mean is at the center. In other words, the Empirical Rule tells us that $99.7\\%$ of observations will fall between $3$ standard deviations below and $3$ standard deviations above the mean.",
