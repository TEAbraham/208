  "solution": "Statement I is true. When working with sets of data, large or small, it is possible that a value could be entered incorrectly.\n\nStatement II is false. It is true that an outlier will affect the mean of the data set. But one should never delete an outlier without first checking to see what caused it.\n\nStatement III is false. A single outlier is not enough to be considered a cluster. There must be several values centered around the same location in order to be considered a cluster.\n\nTherefore, since Statement I is true, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
