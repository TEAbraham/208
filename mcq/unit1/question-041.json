  "solution": "The bar chart is a visualization of a categorical variable. The variable is the proportion of people who sign up for a warranty on their coffee maker. The segmented bar chart shows the proportion who has signed up for the warranty and the proportion who did not sign up for the warranty.\n\nLooking at Company\nC\n, they had approximately\n0.70\nsign up for the warranty, while Company\nA\nhad about\n0.35\nand Company\nB\nhad approximately\n0.55\n, so Company\nC\ndid not have more than Company\nA\nand\nB\ncombined.\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.",
