  "question_text": "Data from the last $10\\text{ years}$ shows that the average high school male has a personal best long jump of $18.9\\text{ feet}$ with a standard deviation of $1.9\\text{ feet}$. The average high school female has a personal best long jump of $16.5\\text{ feet}$ with a standard deviation of $2.2\\text{ feet}$. Both distributions are approximately normally distributed.<br>To earn All-Conference recognition, a jumper typically has to be $2$ standard deviations above the mean for their respective gender.<br>In a survey of $1{,}000$ female long jumpers, about how many girls would you expect to jump so well that they earn All-Conference recognition from not only the girls standard but also the boys standard?",

  "solution": "To earn All-Conference recognition for the boys standard, the girls must jump $2$ or more standard deviations away from the mean of the boys standard. They must jump at least:\n\n$$18.9+1.9+1.9 = 22.7\\text{ feet}$$\n\nCalculate the Z score of a girl who can jump $22.7\\text{ feet}$:\n\n$$\\dfrac{(22.7-16.5)}{2.2} = 2.82$$\n\n$\\text{P(z < 2.82)} = .0024$ using the standard normal table.\n\nSince there are $1{,}000$ girls surveyed, $1000 \\cdot 0.0024 = 2.4$.\n\nOne would expect about $2$ (or $3$) girls to be this exceptional.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
