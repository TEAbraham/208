  "question_text": "Data from the last 10 years shows that the average high school male has a personal best long jump of 18.9 feet with a standard deviation of 1.9 feet . The average high school female has a personal best long jump of 16.5 feet with a standard deviation of 2.2 feet . Both distributions are approximately normally distributed. To earn All-Conference recognition, a jumper typically has to be 2 standard deviations above the mean for their respective gender. In a survey of 1,000 female long jumpers, about how many girls would you expect to jump so well that they earn All-Conference recognition from not only the girls standard but also the boys standard?",
