  "question_text": "Data from the last $10\\text{ years}$ shows that the average high school male has a personal best long jump of $18.9\\text{ feet}$ with a standard deviation of $1.9\\text{ feet}$. The average high school female has a personal best long jump of $16.5\\text{ feet}$ with a standard deviation of $2.2\\text{ feet}$. Both distributions are approximately normally distributed.<br>To earn All-Conference recognition, a jumper typically has to be $2$ standard deviations above the mean for their respective gender.<br>In a survey of $1{,}000$ female long jumpers, about how many girls would you expect to jump so well that they earn All-Conference recognition from not only the girls standard but also the boys standard?",
