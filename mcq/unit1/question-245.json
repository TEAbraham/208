Assume that the city's mean monthly rainfall is normally distributed.<br>Assuming that rainfall varies independently from one month to the next, and that this data is from one location of annual rainfall, determine the probability that this location gets fewer than $25\\text{ inches}$ of rain next year.",

  "solution": "If each month averages $2.183\\text{ inches}$, the mean annual rainfall is $2.183\\cdot 12 = 26.196\\text{ inches}$.\n\nRemember, standard deviations cannot be added, but variances can be added.\n\nThe variances of each month are the sum of the variances of each month:\n\n$$0.424^{2}+0.424^{2}+......+0.424^{2}= 2.157$$\n\nTherefore, the standard deviation of each month is the square root of $2.157$, which is $1.469$.\n\nUse the standard deviation formula below, where $\\mu = 26.196$, $x = 25$, and $\\sigma = 1.469$, to find $z = -0.81.$\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{x- \\mu}{\\sigma}$$\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{25- 26.196}{1.469} = -0.81$$\n\n$$P(z<-0.81) = 0.2090$$\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
