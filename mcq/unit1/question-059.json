  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The test scores are compiled in a stemplot, or stem and leaf plot. In a stemplot, each data value is split into a \"stem\" (the first digit or digits), and a \"leaf\" (usually the last digit).\n\nIn our stemplot, the data is correctly split into stems and leaves. The mistake Mr. Johnson made, was not having a key to display what the data represents. It is very important to include a key at the bottom of your graph (for example, $5 | 7 = 57\\%$) to show what the data inside the graph means.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
