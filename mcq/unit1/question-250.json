  "solution": "While it is true that the standard deviation of a sampling distribution will decrease as the sample size increases, the standard deviation of the standard normal distribution is always $1$.\n\nChoices 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D' all accurately describe characteristics of the standard normal distribution. For Choice 'C', remember that the mean and median of the normal distribution curve are equal.",
