  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The mean is non-resistant to extreme observations whereas the median is not. The mean is pulled towards the tail of the distribution and therefore will be bigger than the median in a skewed right distribution.\n\nExplanation of Distractors Choice 'B' is incorrect as in a skewed left distribution the mean is less than the median since the mean is affected by the lower values. Choices 'D' and 'E' the mean and median will be equal.\n\nPeople often forget what a uniform distribution looks like. A uniform distribution looks like a rectangular box above the $x$-axis, which means that every outcome has the same probability of occurring. Therefore, the mean and median are equal in a uniform distribution.",
