The range is exactly $20\\text{ inches}$.<br>II. The IQR is at least $12\\text{ inches}$.<br>III. The standard deviation is about $8\\text{ inches}$.",

  "solution": "Statement I is incorrect; the minimum is near\n40\n inches\n, and the maximum is near\n62.5\n inches\n, so the range is somewhere near\n22.5\n inches\n. We can't know the exact range without knowing the maximum and minimum values.\n\nStatement II is incorrect; the histogram shows a total of\n17\nvalues.\nQ\n1\nis between the fourth and fifth values (likely around\n47.5\n). The\nQ\n3\nvalue is between the thirteenth and fourteenth values (likely around\n55\n). We can't know the exact IQR without seeing the specific data points, but we can estimate the IQR is likely around\n55\nâˆ’\n47.5\n=\n7.5\n.\n\nIt's impossible to say the IQR would be at least\n12\n.\n\nStatement III is incorrect; the standard deviation is the average distance from the mean. The typical observation is not\n8\ninches from the mean; it is considerably less.\n\nNone of the given statements are correct. Thus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
