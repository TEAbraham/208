  "solution": "When reading an ogive from left to right, we can see that each point adds to the running total for the variable. The point\n(\n6\n,\n0.28\n)\non this ogive means that\n28\n%\nof the employees practiced the recent flash mob\n6\ntimes or less.\n\nThe flattening of the curve at\n2\n,\n3\n,\nand\n4\npractices indicates that no one was added into the running total for those numbers.\n\nThere was one employee who practiced\n2\nor fewer times, but none who practiced\n3\nor\n4\ntimes. The graph rises after that, indicating that many employees practiced\n5\nor more times.\n\nChoice 'E' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. An ogive does not show any trends that develop over time.\n\nChoice 'B' would be correct if it said, \"\n72\n%\nof the employees attended\n8\nor fewer practices.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. An ogive displays only one variable - number of practices. We would need two quantitative variables in order to be able to talk about an association.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The interpretation for the point\n(\n10\n,\n1\n)\nis that\n100\n%\nof the employees practiced\n10\nor fewer times.",
