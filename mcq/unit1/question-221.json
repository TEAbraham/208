  "solution": "Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved.\n\n\n\nFirst, note that the fastest solution times will be less than the mean solution time of $3\\text{ minutes}$, so the answer should be a value below $3$. This is important: the fastest speeds would be the lowest times.\n\nTo solve this problem, use either a table of standard normal probabilities or the “inverse normal” function on a calculator.\n\nThis problem presents a probability of $20\\%$, so look in the body of the table, and you will find a $z$-value closest to $-0.84$ corresponding to an area of $0.20$ as shown in the image above.\n\nNow use the conversion formula:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{(X-\\mu)}{\\sigma}$$\n\n...to find the cutoff score.\n\n$$-0.84 =\\dfrac{ (X-3)}{0.4}$$\n\n$$(-.84)(0.4) = X-3$$\n\n$$-0.336 = X-3$$\n\n$$2.66=X$$\n\nSo $X$ is $3-0.336$, or $2.66$, which rounds to $2.7$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
