  "solution": "A stem plot would be the best way to graph this quantitative data. Stem plots are always appropriate to graph single variable, quantitative data.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; pie charts deal only with categorical data.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; a scatterplot is used only to plot bivariate data.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; bar graphs deal only with categorical data.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; the range of this data is so large that a dot plot would do a poor job of showing the shape of this distribution.",
