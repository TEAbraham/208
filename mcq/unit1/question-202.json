  "solution": "The figure shows an area between two standard deviations below the mean and three standard deviations above the mean.\n\nFirst, figure out the value for two standard deviations below the mean:\n\n$$\\mu -2\\sigma =150-(2)(25)=100 \\ \\text{ words per minute}$$\n\nWe can eliminate Choices 'A' ,'D', and 'E' because they all state a lower bound of $125$ words per minute.\n\nNext, figure out the value for three standard deviations above the mean:\n\n$$\\mu +3\\sigma =150+(3)(25)=225 \\ \\text{ words per minute}$$\n\nChoice 'C' is our answer.",
