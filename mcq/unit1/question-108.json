  "solution": "The median best describes what the typical observation is in a data set.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; since the distribution is right-skewed, the mean will be pushed to the right, which runs the risk of exaggerating what the typical employee earns.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; the mode might only describe what two of the employees earn; if every employee earns a different amount, there wonâ€™t even be a mode.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' are incorrect; these selections give measures of spread and do not accurately describe what the typical employee earns.",
