  "solution": "The librarian is randomly selected books to collect <strong>data</strong>. This data, once collected, can lead to a conclusion that is meaningful, when put into context. \n\nAlthough the students do not know the exact reasoning for the librarian's work, <strong>both</strong> of their ideas make sense statistically. The librarian could easily find the average number of pages of the book by examining each book and finding the sum of the book pages, then dividing by the number of books. Additionally, the librarian could also easily organize the books into different categories that represent each book. \n\nBoth students have presented a logical statistical argument for what the librarian could be doing. \n\n<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is correct.
