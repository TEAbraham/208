  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn statistics, a variable is a characteristics that changes from one individual to another. We collect information on variables from subjects.\n\nIn this problem, data was collected from our subjects, the 150 students, on the following variables: height, eye color, amount of sleep last night, and eye color.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. Since height is a number that will change from one person to another, it is considered a variable.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Student's favorite class is a value that could change from student to student, therefore it is a variable.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Amount of sleep is a numeric value that will change from one person to another, it is also considered a variable.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since not everyone's eye color is the same, eye color is also a variable.",
