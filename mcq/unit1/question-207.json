  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "A $z$-score tells us how many standard deviations an observation is above or below the mean. If the observation is above the mean, the $z$-score will be positive while an observation below the mean will have a negative $z$-score. Emily's $z$-score is positive, so Choice 'D' is the proper interpretation of the $z$-score.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. A $z$-score does not measure how many additional hours of sleep Emily got.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. A $z$-score does not indicate that the median would be multiplied by the $z$-score.\n\nChoice 'C' is a correct statement (assuming the distribution of Emily's sleep times is approximately normal). However, it is not a correct interpretation of the $z$-score.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. A $z$-score does not provide an actual value for the number of hours of sleep. It would be very sad and perhaps dangerous if $1.5$ hours of sleep corresponded to a $z$-score of $1.5$! That would mean that the average number of hours of sleep that Emily gets is less than $1.5$ hours.",
