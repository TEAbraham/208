  "question_text": "In golf, par is determined by the number of strokes a golfer without advantage (or handicap, as it is termed) is expected to take on a given hole.<br>The dot plots shown above are for two groups of golfers on a par $3$ course. The top dot plot is a summary of the total scores for $9\\text{ holes}$ by $16$ inexperienced golfers, and the bottom dot plot is a summary of the total scores on the same course for $16$ experienced golfers.<br>Which of the following statements is true concerning these two distributions?<br><br>Created for Albert.io.

  "solution": "Exact calculations are unnecessary for answering this question.\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; it is clear that the means for the distributions are significantly different. The data for the experienced golfers is clustered at about 27\n, while the mean for the new golfers appears to be in the low to mid-30\ns.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the data for the experienced golfers are clustered at about 27\n, whereas the data for the new golfers has a relatively large spread.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; the dot plot for the experienced golfers is roughly normal in shape, with almost no skewness, whereas the dot plot for the new golfers is highly skewed to the right.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; by inspection, it is easy to see that the experienced golfers dot plot has no outliers.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
