  "solution": "The weights are normally distributed and the mean weight of $7.5\\text{ pounds}$ is located at the center of the normal distribution curve. We want to capture the middle $50\\%$, therefore, we want to include an area of $25\\%$ to the left of center and an area of $25\\%$ to the right of center. First, we must find the $z$-scores associated with the endpoints of this interval. Then, we will convert the $z$-scores to raw values.\n\nStart by looking for the $z$-score that corresponds with the area of $25\\%$ to the left of center. Based on the symmetry of the curve, there is also an area of $25\\%$ to the left of this location. To find the corresponding $z$-score, look in the $z$-table until you find the entry closest to $0.25$ and match it up with the related $z$-score of $-0.67$.\n\nTo use the TI83/84 graphing calculator, you will need to use the invNorm function. The invNorm function provides the $z$-score that corresponds with a given area to the left. The syntax is invNorm(area to the left).\n\nIn this case:\n\nEnter 2nd, DISTR\nChoose invNorm\nEnter 0.25\n\nEnter again and the calculator will return the $z$-score of $z = -0.67$.\n\nDue to the symmetry of the curve, we can now also establish that the $z$-score related to the location which has an area of $25\\%$ to the right of center is $z = 0.67$.\n\nNext, we will use the formula for calculating $z$-scores to determine the raw values (weights) that match up with the above $z$-scores. The formula for calculating $z$ is:\n\n$$z=\\frac { x-\\mu }{ \\sigma }$$\n\n...where $x$ is the observed value or value of interest.\n\nFor both $z$-scores, fill in the known values and solve for $x$.\n\n$$-0.67=\\frac { x- 7.5 }{ 1.25 } $$\n\nSolve to find $x = 6.7$\n\n$$0.67= \\frac { x-7.5 }{ 1.25 } $$\n\nSolve to find $x = 8.3$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. The endpoints of this interval are both $3$ standard deviations away from the mean. Therefore, it covers the middle $99.7\\%$ of weights according to the Empirical Rule.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The endpoints of this interval are both $2$ standard deviations away from the mean. Therefore, it covers the middle $95\\%$ of weights according to the Empirical Rule.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. The endpoints of this interval are both $1$ standard deviation away from the mean. Therefore, it covers the middle $68\\%$ according to the Empirical Rule.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This interval covers roughly the middle $62\\%$ of the weights.",
