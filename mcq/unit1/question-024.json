  "solution": "The table shown represents the categorical variable, \"Favorite Coffee\". The put all subjects into their respective category.\n\nSince the researcher asked 400 people, the total amount of people represented in the table needs to equal that amount. The two values given in the table, 125 and 65, equal 190. Therefore, the two values must add to be 210 subjects. The only answer choice that equals 210 is 120+90 which is Choice 'D'.\n\nSo, Choice 'D' is correct.",
