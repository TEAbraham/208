  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe table shown represents the categorical variable, \"Favorite Coffee\". The put all subjects into their respective category.\n\nSince the researcher asked 400\npeople, the total amount of people represented in the table needs to equal that amount. The two values given in the table, 125\nand 65\n, equal 190\n. Therefore, the two values must add to be 210\nsubjects. The only answer choice that equals 210\nis 120+90\nwhich is Choice 'D'.\n\nSo, Choice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Since the table accounts for 190\nsubjects, the values must add to 210\n. 210+10=220\n, not 210\n.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The missing values need to add to be 210\n, not 200\n.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. As stated above, the missing values need to add to be 210\n, not 200\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. The missing values must add to 210\n, 50+50\nonly equals 100\n.",
