  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "A distribution would likely have clusters if there are subgroups who would have markedly different measurements for the variable displayed.\n\n5th-grade girls typically keep their hair longer than 5th-grade boys. We would therefore expect to see a cluster of measurements around one to two inches (boys) and a second cluster of measurements around ten or twelve inches (girls).\n\nThe other answer choices do not describe groups that would be remarkably different from each other for the variable described.",
