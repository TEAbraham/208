  "solution": "The interquartile range (IQR) represents Q3-Q1.\n\nIn this case, it is approximately: $90-27=63$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors Choice 'A' is incorrect as this represents the interval of the data set. Choice 'B' is incorrect as this represents the interval from Quartile 1 to Quartile 3. Choice 'C' is incorrect as this represents half the range. Choice 'E' is incorrect as this represents the range(maximum value - minimum value).",
