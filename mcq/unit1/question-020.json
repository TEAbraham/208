  "solution": "Sam's survey collected data on individuals from the supermarket. The data can be split into two groups: quantitative or categorical. A quantitative variable is one that takes one a value that can be measured whereas a categorical variable takes on values that are category names or group names.\n\nAlthough zip code is a numeric value, it is not a value that can be measured from one person to another. Another way to think about it is, we cannot find the average zip code. Since we cannot find the numeric average, the value is categorical.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
