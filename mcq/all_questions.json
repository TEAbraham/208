    "solution": "The ages of employees at the tech start-up are summarized in a cumulative relative frequency graph, or Ogive. A cumulative graph represents the number or proportion of a data set less than or equal to a given number. You can find the proportion of data points in a certain interval by finding the percent for the upper bound and the percent for the lower bound and subtracting the two values.\n\nWhen looking at this ogive, to find the proportion of employees younger than 40\n, follow the horizontal axis until you get to 40\nyears old. Then move vertically until you hit the line graph, and make a right angle to the vertical axis. You find the proportion of employees 40\nyears old or younger is approximately 0.52\n, which is over half of the employees.\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.",

This would imply a negative association, meaning as the values of one variable increases, the values of the other variable tend to decrease.\n\nSince the graph is showing a negative association, and not a positive association, the golfer's belief is incorrect.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",

Since the slope of the equation, $\\hat{y} = a + bx$, is represented by $b$, the slope in our equation is $1.2$.

Which side receives which formula will be determined at random and the hair on the left side of the head will always be shampooed first.\nAfter the hair is then dried and styled to the individual's preference, each individual will be asked to rate how soft and silky their hair feels on the side with the original formula and on the side with the new formula.

    "question_text": "A manufacturer of hair care products believes that they have developed a new formula for their shampoo that will leave hair feeling softer and silkier. The shampoo that contains the new formula looks and smells like the original formula, so those who use the shampoo would not be able to tell the two formulas apart.\nSeveral volunteers who use the company's shampoo have agreed to help them test their theory, and since the group of volunteers is very diverse, the manufacturer believes that the volunteers actually would be a good representation of the population of individuals who would use their shampoo.\nFor this study, each volunteer will have the hair on one side of their head shampooed with the original formula and the hair on the other side of their head shampooed with the new formula. Which side receives which formula will be determined at random and the hair on the left side of the head will always be shampooed first.\nAfter the hair is then dried and styled to the individual's preference, each individual will be asked to rate how soft and silky their hair feels on the side with the original formula and on the side with the new formula. Ratings will be based on a scale from $1$ to $5$ with $1$ being \"not soft and silky\" and $5$ being \"the most soft and silky\". The difference between the new formula rating and the old formula rating will be recorded for each individual in the study.\nWhat would it mean for this experiment to be double blind? Why is this an important characteristic of the experiment?",

Additionally, since the substances are the different conditions that are being applied, this makes them the treatments in the experiment. Since the study is an experiment, we can prove a cause-and-effect relationship between the substances and the spin rate. And finally, since the baseballs were randomly assigned, we can generalize about the whole population of baseballs.\n\nTherefore, since all the above answers are correct, we must select Choice 'E'.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",

Every year, millions of people \"fill out their brackets\" and try to predict the winner of each and every game. Of course, some teams in the tournament are better than others and receive a higher seed or ranking at the beginning of the tournament. The team with the higher seed should theoretically win the game. However, strange things happen during March Madness!\nA big believer in the theory that on any given day, either team could win, Jordan wondered about the probability of selecting every winning team in the tournament by selecting the winner of each game at random. A total of $64$ teams play in the tournament. The first round of the tournament consists of $32$ games. The second round consists of $16$ games. The third round consists of $8$ games. The next round consists of $4$ games and the round after that consists of $2$ games. Finally a winner is determined in a single game between $2$ teams.\nIf Jordan is correct and either team is equally likely to win a game, what is the probability of correctly selecting the winner of every game in the tournament by selecting the winning teams randomly?",

Many people believe that if an outcome occurs using a chance process, that the outcome can no longer happen, even if it has a probability of doing so. Using a completely random chance process implies that each individual has an equally likely chance of being selected every time the process is used.\n\nIn this case, the football players selected for testing as selected using a chance process. Therefore, every player has an equally likely chance of being selected each week. Therefore, even though the probability could be relatively small, the athlete that was selected five weeks in a row simply was due to randomness, not anything nefarious.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",

Some people believe that the color tricks spiders, wasps and other insects into thinking that the ceiling is the sky and that this reduces the number of insects found on the porches.\nDixie wonders if this is really true and decides to investigate. She enlists the help of $35$ homeowners in South Carolina whose homes have porches. On each of these homes she paints half of the porch ceiling white and half of the porch ceiling light blue. Which half gets which color is determined by tossing a coin. She also places an insect trap on both sides of each porch.\nAfter a period of two weeks, she counts the number of insects caught in each trap and determines the average number of insects caught near each color of paint. Her results are shown in the table below.\nSample Mean Sample Standard Deviation\nBlue Paint 86.4 4.9\nWhite Paint 87.7 5.2\nDifference (Blue - White) -1.3 7.1\n\n\nAssuming all conditions are satisfied, what is the $p$-value for a test to determine whether using light blue paint on porch ceilings will reduce the mean number of bugs on the porch?",
