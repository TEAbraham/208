Thirty-two patients were to be randomly selected from a group of headache sufferers from several medical practices in a large city.  Four different dosages of the drug would be administered and the number of headaches would be counted over a period of time.  Data was carefully documented and residuals were examined. A <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$t$</span>-test was to be done using the following hypotheses:</div><div class=\"paragraph\"><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$H_{0}: \\beta=0$</span></div><div class=\"paragraph\"><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$H_{a}: \\beta\\neq0$</span></div><div class=\"paragraph\">Something is wrong here.
