  "solution": "When looking at a regression model, there are <strong>explanatory</strong> and <strong>response</strong> variables. The explanatory variable is the variable that is causing the response, and in this problem would be the max squat weight for the jumpers. The response variable is the variable that is being measured, and in this problem would the predicted long-jump distance. \n\nTherefore, the response variable for the trainer's regression model is distance jumped. \n\n<strong>Choice 'A'</strong> is correct.
