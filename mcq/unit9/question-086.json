  "question_text": "A statistics student wants to know if the grade a student earns on the statistics final exam can be predicted from the grade they earn on the statistics midterm exam. Below is a computer output for linear regression of final exam scores versus midterm exam scores from a sample of $40$ randomly chosen students at the school.<br>The student will test the hypotheses Ho: $\\beta = 0$ vs Ha: $\\beta > 0$. Assuming conditions for inference have been checked and met, which is the following is the appropriate conclusion to make, using an $\\alpha$ level of $0.05$?",
