  "question_text": "An amateur mountain biker is grooming old trails with berms so that turns ride safer and faster. The number of hours spent grooming trails is linearly related to the height of each berm. The computer output from the linear regression of berm height on time spent grooming for $40$ days of work is given below.<br>Assuming conditions for inference are met, what is the margin of error for a $95\\%$ confidence interval on berm height versus hours spent working?",

  "solution": "Choice 'D' is correct.\n\nMargin of Error $=$ critical value $\\times$ standard error\n\nM.o.E. $= (t_{38}^*) ($SE Coef Berm Height$)$\n\nTo find the critical value of $t_{38}^*$, use software...\n\nM.o.E. $\\approx(2.0244)(1.29433)$\n\nM.o.E. $\\approx2.6202$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake made here is using the critical value $t^*\\approx1.68595$ for a $90 \\%$ confidence interval; that is to say, $95\\%$ of the area falls to the left of the critical value used.\n\nSince we are computing margin of error for a confidence interval, we need $2.75\\%$ to fall on each extreme.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect.\n\nWhile the correct area ($0.975$) is used to locate the upper critical value, the distribution is incorrectly identified. The mistake made here is using a standard normal critical value of $z^*\\approx1.96$. Inference on regression uses a $t$-interval with $n-2$ degrees of freedom.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect.\n\nWhile the correct area, $0.975$, is used to locate the upper critical value, the incorrect degrees of freedom, $df=40$ was used. With each different degree of freedom comes a different $t$-distribution curve. Thus the incorrect critical value $t^*\\approx2.0211$ has area $0.975$ below it for the $t_{40}$ distribution.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect.\n\nThe value $2.0244$ represents only the critical value $t_{38}^*$ for a $95\\%$ confidence interval. The product of this value AND the SE Coef Berm Height make up the full margin of error.",
