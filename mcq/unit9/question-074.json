  "question_text": "An amateur mountain biker is grooming old trails with berms so that turns ride safer and faster. The number of hours spent grooming trails is linearly related to the height of each berm. The computer output from the linear regression of berm height on time spent grooming for $40$ days of work is given below.<br>Assuming conditions for inference are met, what is the margin of error for a $95\\%$ confidence interval on berm height versus hours spent working?",
