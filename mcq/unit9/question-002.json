  "question_text": "A sports researcher examines data to determine if a team's average points per game can be used as a predictor for the number of games the team won throughout the season. Of the $350$ teams in the division, the sports researcher selects a random sample of $15$ teams. After he runs the linear regression on the data, he finds the least-squares regression line for the variables points per game ($x$) and the predicted number of wins ($\\hat{y}$) to be:<br>$\\widehat{\\text{wins}} = 15.52 + 0.056(\\text{points per game})$<br>What question is unknown to the researcher after creating the regression model?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer",
  "solution": "When looking at the regression model, it is important to remember that the sports researcher selected a random sample of $20$ teams from the division population of $350$ teams. Since this process was done randomly, the researcher has to understand that his results could have possibly happened purely by chance, and are not statistically significant. Therefore, the researcher cannot be sure that the slope of the least squares regression line for this model will always be positive.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
