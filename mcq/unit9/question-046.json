  "question_text": "An NBA basketball player is interested if there is an association between the amount of time a player practices his three-point shooting(in hours) and the percentage of three pointers made. Since the NBA player took AP Statistics in high school, he knew of a perfect way to design his study and share it with his NBA friends.<br>He randomly selected $20$ NBA players and asked them how much time they spent practicing shooting behind the arc (shooting $3$ pointers). He then looked up their three-point percentage. A computer output from fitting a least squares regression line to the data is shown below.<br>Dependent variable is: % of 3-Pointers Made<br>$R^2 = 91.24\\%$\n$S=0.052$<br>Which of the following is the standard error of the slope?<br>Which of the following is the standard error of the slope?",

Find where the s.e. coeff column and the practice time row intersect. This number is $0.000849$ which is Choice 'B'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as the standard error the slope was divided by the $\\sqrt { 20 } $\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as the standard error of the y-intercept was used and divided by the $\\sqrt { 20 }$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect as $20.001$ represents the standard error of the y-intercept.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect as $0.052$ represents the standard error of the residuals.",
