  "question_text": "​An NBA basketball player is interested if there is an association between the amount of time a player practices his three-point shooting(in hours) and the percentage of three pointers made.  Since the NBA player took AP Statistics in high school,  he knew of a perfect way to design his study and share it with his  NBA friends. He randomly selected $20$ NBA players and asked them how much time they spent practicing shooting behind the arc (shooting $3$ pointers).  He then looked up their three-point percentage.  A computer output from fitting a least squares regression line to the data is shown below. Dependent variable is: % of  3-Pointers Made $R^2 = 91.24\\%$ $S=0.052$ Variable: Coefficient s.e Coeff t-ratio prob Constant: 30.1 20.001 1.505 .075 Practice Time 0.002 0.000849 2.356 0.03 Which of the following is the standard error of the slope?",
