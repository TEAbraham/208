  "solution": "The test statistic in a slope-regression t-test is given by the formula:\n\n$$\\frac { b-\\beta }{ { S.E. }_{ b } }$$\n\n...where $b$ represents the sample slope and $\\beta $ represents the population slope. $\\beta $ in this case is $0$ as this is stated in the problem.\n\nTo find $b$ and the ${ S.E. }_{ b }$ you must use the regression analysis table.\n\nThe sample slope in this case $1.084$, as this represents the coefficient of the height, meaning the number in front of the height.\n\nThus we can eliminate Choices 'C', 'D', 'E'.\n\nChoice 'B' can also be eliminated as we don't divide by the square root of the sample size to find the slope test statistic.",
