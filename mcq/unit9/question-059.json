  "question_text": "NBA scouts are always interested in the relationship between the height of NBA players and their respective wingspans. An NBA scout randomly selects $19$ players and measures their heights and wingspans. Below is the computer regression analysis of height and wingspan.\nDependent variable is wingspan.\n$R^2 = 0.787$\n$S = 2.23$\nDegrees of Freedom = $17$\nVariable Coefficient SE(Coeff) t-ratio P-value\nConstant -2.273 0.945 -2.405 <0.014\nHeight 1.084 0.24 4.52 <0.0001\n\n\nAssuming all the conditions for inference are met, which of the following represents the test statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the slope of the population regression line equals $0$?",
