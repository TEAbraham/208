  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Apple tree saplings can produce fruit in as little as <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span> years.  Jeff, a novice farmer, believes that picking fruit in the spring before it has time to develop during years <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span> through <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$7$</span> can increase the yield in years <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8$</span> through <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$11$</span> significantly.  By pruning the apples from saplings, more energy is devoted to trunk and branch development, thus creating a stronger more capable fruit bearer.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Jeff collected data from an experiment in which <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10$</span> groups of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10$</span> trees, selected at random had <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10\\%$</span>, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$20\\%$</span>, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$30\\%$</span>, ... <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100\\%$</span> of the apples pruned from the trees in the spring during years <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span> through <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$7$</span>.  The treatment groups were then plotted against natural yield in years <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8$</span> through <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$11$</span>.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Assuming the conditions for regression inference are met, what are the null and alternative hypotheses that Jeff should use to assess his belief?</div>",
