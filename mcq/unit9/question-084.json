  "question_text": "Apple tree saplings can produce fruit in as little as $4$ years. Jeff, a novice farmer, believes that picking fruit in the spring before it has time to develop during years $4$ through $7$ can increase the yield in years $8$ through $11$ significantly. By pruning the apples from saplings, more energy is devoted to trunk and branch development, thus creating a stronger more capable fruit bearer.<br>Jeff collected data from an experiment in which $10$ groups of $10$ trees, selected at random had $10\\%$, $20\\%$, $30\\%$, ... $100\\%$ of the apples pruned from the trees in the spring during years $4$ through $7$. The treatment groups were then plotted against natural yield in years $8$ through $11$.<br>Assuming the conditions for regression inference are met, what are the null and alternative hypotheses that Jeff should use to assess his belief?",
