  "solution": "Solution\n\nWhen finding a confidence interval for the slope of a regression line, the following formula should be used:\n\n$$b\\pm t^{*} (SE_{b})$$\n\n...where $b$ is the slope of the line of best fit, $t^{*}$ is the critical value, and $ SE_{b}$ is the standard error of the slope.\n\nThe value following the plus or minus sign is also called the margin of error. In this problem, we are given a standard error equal to $1.5$, a slope equal to $8.66$, and a lower bound of $5.06$. Plugging these into the equation above, and using the minus sign for the lower bound, we get:\n\n$$8.66-(t^{*})(1.5)=5.06$$\n\nThus, we must first solve for $t^{*}$.\n\nFirst, we subtract $8.66$ from both sides and then we divide both sides by $-1.5$ to get $t^{*}=2.4$.\n\nFinally, since we know that the margin of error is equal to $t^{*} (SE_{b})$, we simply multiply $2.4$ by $1.5$ to get our answer of $3.6$.\n\nSo, Choice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because $2.4$ is the value of $t^{*}$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because $2.4$ is the value of $t^{*}$ with the minus sign improperly attached due to the given lower bound.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the answer $3.6$ has a minus sign improperly attached due to the given lower bound.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because this is the value of the upper bound.",
