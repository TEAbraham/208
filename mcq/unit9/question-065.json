  "solution": "In general, a high $p$-value exists in a linear regression T-test, therefore giving evidence for ${H}_{0}$.\n\nHowever, in this situation, ${H}_{0}$ says the slope = $1$, indicating a direct linear relationship.\n\nTherefore, there is insufficient evidence of a direct linear relationship, but it is certainly possible some linear relationship exists.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
