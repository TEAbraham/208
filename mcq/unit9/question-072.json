  "question_text": "The height that a mountain biker achieves off of a jump is directly related to his comfort level with the jump. We will assume that conditions for regression inference are met.\nOver his first $10$ runs at a newly designed downhill course, Will's jump height is found to increase an average of $4$ cm every time he goes off the jump. A computer output from this regression is shown below:\nWhat procedure is appropriate for computing a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the slope of the true regression line that relates Will's height to the number of completed runs on the newly designed downhill course?",
