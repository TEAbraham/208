  "solution": "This question is asking whether there is a linear association between height and wingspan of NBA Players. The type of test we are going to run is a regression slope t-test.\n\nThe hypotheses are:\n\n${ H }_{ 0 }:\\beta =0$\n$ {H }_{ A }:\\beta \\neq 0$\n\n...where $\\beta$ represents the population slope.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis is $\\neq$ to $0$ since we are trying to find evidence of a linear relationship.\n\nWhen given a regression analysis table like the one above it will always be for a two-sided test unless stated otherwise.\n\nIn this case, since we are dealing with the slope, we are going to look for the $P$-value that relates to the slope.\n\nAll of the numbers that relate to the slope are in the row of data for our explanatory variable which in this case is Height.\n\nThe $P$-value given here is $<0.0001$.\n\nSince the $P$-value of approximately $0$ is less than $0.01$, there is sufficient evidence of a linear association.\n\nChoices 'A' and 'B' can be eliminated as that $P$-value deals with the $y$-intercept.\n\nChoice 'C' can be eliminated as there is sufficient evidence.\n\nNext, we will find the slope of LSRL to determine if we have a positive or negative linear association. The slope, in this case, is $1.084$ which is positive so therefore we have a positive linear association.\n\nChoice 'D' is our answer.\n\nOne thing to note is since we are looking for the direction of the linear association we would have to divide the $P$-value by $2$ because a linear regression analysis table always deals with two-sided tests unless stated otherwise.",
