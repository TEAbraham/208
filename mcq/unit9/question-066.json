  "solution": "The formula for a slope regression $t$-interval is:\n\n$$b\\pm ({ t }_{ n-2 }^{*}\\cdot { S.E. }_{ b })$$\n\n...where the margin of error is the content after the $\\pm$. In this case, the margin of error is :\n\n$$({ t }_{ n-2 }^{ * }\\cdot { S.E. }_{ b })$$\n\nTo find the margin of error, first find the critical value. We have $95\\%$ confidence with $24$ ($26-2$) degrees of freedom. Looking at the $t$-distribution chart find where $95\\%$ confidence and $24$ D.O.F. intersect; they come together at $2.064$. Therefore, we can eliminate Choices 'A', 'C', and 'E'.\n\nThe standard error of the slope is given on the table. It is represented by the standard error coefficient of the $x$-variable, which in this case is the standard error of the chocolate. Looking at the table the value for this is $0.0217$.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and results from the pulling the $p$ value of the $t$-distribution at degrees of freedom of $26$ instead of $24$.\n\nChoices 'C', 'D', and 'E' are incorrect as they are divided by the square root of the sample size.",
