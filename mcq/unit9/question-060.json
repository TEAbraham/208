  "question_text": "A high school principal is curious if a linear relationship exists between student height and score on a self-esteem test.<br>A random sample of $20$ pairs of students was taken. A linear regression $T$-test was performed on $H_0: B = 0$ vs. $H_a: B > 0$, and the test statistic of $t = 3.19$ was calculated.<br>If the slope is $1.22$ and margin of error was $3.41$ for a $95\\%$ confidence interval, what was the standard error of the slope?",

  "solution": "The margin of error for a linear regression t-interval is given in the formula below:\n\n$$\\text{Margin of Error} = t^*{ SE }_{ b }$$\n\nIn this case, the margin of error is $3.41$, as stated in the problem.\n\n$t^*$ is $2.101$ and is found by seeing where $95\\%$ confidence meets $n-2 = 18$ degrees of freedom.\n\n$b$ is the slope, which is $1.22$, but this value, as well as the test statistic, will not be used in this problem.\n\nUse algebra to solve for the equation for the standard error of the slope. The steps are shown below.\n\n$$3.41 = 2.101 \\times { SE }_{ b }$$\n\nBy dividing both sides by $2.101$:\n\n$$1.623={ SE }_{ b }$$\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
