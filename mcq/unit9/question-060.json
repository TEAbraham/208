  "question_text": "A high school principal is curious if a linear relationship exists between student height and score on a self-esteem test.\nA random sample of $20$ pairs of students was taken. A linear regression $T$-test was performed on $H_0: B = 0$ vs. $H_a: B > 0$, and the test statistic of $t = 3.19$ was calculated.\nIf the slope is $1.22$ and margin of error was $3.41$ for a $95\\%$ confidence interval, what was the standard error of the slope?",
