  "solution": "One would expect a strong, positive correlation between a child’s shoe size and age. Therefore, $r$ should be positive and fairly high, between $0.7$ and $1$.\n\nThe test statistic should be fairly high and positive. Since there is a strong positive linear relationship between a child’s height and age, one would expect the test results to show a test statistic value many standard deviations above the mean for a sample this large.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
