  "question_text": "A statistics student asks $28$ other students to build paper airplanes without specific instructions as to size. He asks them to record both the length of the planes and the length of the flights. He wants to create a confidence interval for the slope of the regression equation to see if the length of plane is linearly related to the length of flight . You are given a regression analysis computer output table below.<br>Assuming that all conditions have been verified and ignoring units, find the upper bound of the $95\\%$ confidence interval for this data.",
