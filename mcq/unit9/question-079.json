Below is the linear regression output for a randomly chosen group of $50$ middle school students. These $50$ students were asked to rank both their science and their math class on a scale of $0$ to $5$ (the higher the rating, the more the student enjoys the class).\nPredictor Coef SE Coef $T$ $P$\nConstant $1.187$ $0.56$ $2.44$ $0.042$\nScience $0.5254$ $0.1995$ $2.63$ $0.014$\nWhich of the following is the correct value and the correct interpretation of the $P$-value of the test for the hypotheses Ho: $\\beta = 0$ vs Ha: $\\beta > 0$?",
