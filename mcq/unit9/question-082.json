He applied $4$ levels of treatment, each to $4$ sections of his lawn at random, and recorded the change in crabgrass plants per square meter.<br>Regression analysis was performed and a $98\\%$ confidence interval for the slope of the true regression line of change in crabgrass on treatment was constructed.<br>$98\\%$ Confidence Interval: $ (-1.134, -0.8364)$<br>A lawn care company ran an experiment that tested the same $4$ levels, but each on $200$ sections of lawn at random.<br>The $98\\%$ Confidence Interval obtained by the lawn care company is likely to be $\\rule{3cm}{0.25mm}$ in comparison to the confidence interval constructed by Rob.",
