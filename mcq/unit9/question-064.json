  "solution": "When conducting a $t$-test for the slope of a LSRL, the $t$-statistic is calculated as follows:\n\n$$t=\\dfrac { { b }_{ 1 } }{ SE } $$\n\n... where $ { b }_{ 1 } $ is the slope of the LSRL or the estimated slope based upon the sample observations and $SE$ represents the standard error of the slope.\n\nThe equation of the LSRL is given as:\n\n$$\\hat { y } =25.87-3.18x$$\n\nThis follows the format for the equation of an LSRL given in the reference materials provided on the AP exam. That is:\n\n$$\\hat { y } ={ b }_{ 0 }+{ b }_{ 1 }x$$\n\nWe can see that the slope of the LSRL or the value of ${b}_{1} = -3.18$.\n\nNow we can find the value of the $t$-statistic by filing in the formula:\n\n$$t=\\dfrac { -3.18 }{ 1.72 } =-1.849$$\n\nTo calculate the $p$-value, we must first determine the appropriate degrees of freedom (df). For a $t$-test for the slope of a LSRL, the appropriate $df$ is $n-2$ where $n$ is the number of observations. Therefore:\n\n$$df=12-2=10$$\n\nNow we are ready to find the corresponding $p$-value. There are two ways to do this.\n\nMETHOD 1\n\nUse your TI83/84 calculator's tcdf function. The tcdf function finds the area (or associated probability) under the curve representing a $t$-distribution where certain values are specified. The syntax is:\n\ntcdf(lower bound, upper bound, df)\n\nSince we are running a test with a two-sided alternative hypothesis AND our $t$-statistic is negative, we will find the area to the left of our calculated $t$-statistic and then double it to obtain the two-sided $p$-value. There is no lower bound in this calculation, so we will use ${ -10 }^{ 99 }$ as our lower bound to ensure that our answer is quite accurate. On your calculator:\n\nPress 2nd\nPress VARS (DISTR)\nSelect tcdf\nEnter -10^99, -1.849, 10\nPress Enter\n\nYour calculator will return the one-sided $p$-value of $0.047$. Multiply this value by $2$ to obtain the two-sided $p$-value of $0.094$.\n\nMETHOD 2\n\nUse the $t$-table which can be found in the reference materials provided with the AP exam. This table provides upper tail probabilities associated with given degrees of freedom. Since only upper tail probabilities are given, we must rely on the fact that the $t$-distribution is symmetric about $0$. This means that the area to the left of our $t$-statistic of $-1.849$ will be equal to the area to the right of $t=1.849$.\n\nTo use this table then, look down the column labeled df to find $df=10$. Then look across this row to try to find a $t$-statistic of $1.849$. You will not be able to find this value in the $t$-table. However, we know that $1.849$ falls between $1.812$ and $2.228$. Both of these values are in the $t$-table and we can find their associated upper tail probabilities by looking at the top of the columns where these values are found.\n\nSince $p(t > 1.812)=0.05$ and $p(t > 2.228)=0.025$ we can determine that $0.05 > p(t > 1.849) > 0.025$. Multiply all parts of this inequality by $2$ and we find: $0.10 > 2p(t > 1.849) > 0.05$. Therefore, the $p$-value that we need is between $0.05$ and $0.10$. From the given choices, $p=0.094$ is the only appropriate $p$-value and must therefore be correct.\n\nWe now know that:\n\n$$t = -1.849$$\n\n$$p = 0.094$$\n\nTherefore, the correct choice is Choice 'C'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This $t$-statistic is found by incorrectly using the opposite of the $y$-intercept as the slope of the LSRL.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because it provides the $p$-value that would correspond to a one-sided alternative hypothesis direction in the less than direction.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The $t$-statistic reported here disregards the negative nature of the slope of the LSRL. Also, the $p$-value provided would correspond to a one-sided alternative hypothesis in the greater than direction.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This $t$-statistic is found by incorrectly using the of the $y$-intercept as the slope of the LSRL. Furthermore, the $p$-value provided does not correspond with this $t$-statistic.\n\nNote: Do not forget to use strategy when answering exam problems. Here, once you know that $t=-1.849$, you can eliminate Choices 'A', 'D', and 'E' as possible answers to this problem. If you also remember that your alternative hypothesis is two-sided and then recognize that the $p$-value provided in Choice 'C' is double the $p$-value provided in Choice 'B' you may be able to guess that Choice 'C' is correct. Of course, be sure to check that answer if you are able!",
