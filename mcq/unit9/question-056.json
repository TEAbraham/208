  "solution": "The formula for a slope regression $t$-interval is:\n\n$$b\\pm ({ t }_{ n-2 }^{ * }\\cdot { S.E. }_{ b })$$\n\n...where $b$ represents the sample slope, $t$ is the critical value with $n-2$ degrees of freedom, and the final part is the standard error of the slope.\n\nThe slope in this case $1.084$, as that represents the coefficient of the height, meaning the number in front of the height. Looking at our answer choices, we can eliminate Choices 'A' and 'B'.\n\nTo find the critical value for $t$, we are given $18$ degrees of freedom and $95\\%$ confidence. Looking at the $t$-distribution table, find where $18$ degrees of freedom and $95\\%$ intersect. You will see that is at $2.101$. As a result, Choice 'E' shows all of these correctly placed.\n\nWe can, therefore, eliminate Choices 'C' and 'D'.\n\nIn addition, Choice 'D' is the trap, because it uses the degrees of freedom as the sample size ($20$) and $n - 2$ ($20-2=18$).",
