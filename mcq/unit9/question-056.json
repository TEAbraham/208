  "question_text": "NBA scouts are always interested in the relationship between the height of NBA players and their wingspans. An NBA scout randomly selects $20$ players and measures their heights and respective wingspans. Below is the computer regression analysis of wingspan and height: Dependent variable is: Wingspan $R^2 = 0.787$ $S=2.23$ Variable Coefficient SE(Coeff) t-ratio P-value Constant -2.273 0.39 -5.83 <0.0001 Height 1.084 0.24 4.51 <0.0001 Assuming all of the conditions have been satisfied, which of the following gives a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the slope of the regression line?",
