  "question_text": "An NBA basketball player is interested if there is an association between the amount of time a player practices his three-point shooting (in hours) and the percentage of three pointers made.  Since the NBA player took AP Statistics in high school,  he knew of a perfect way to design his study and share it with his  NBA friends.  He randomly selected $20$ NBA players and asked them how much time they spent practicing shooting behind the arc (shooting 3 pointers).  He then looked up their three-point percentage.  A computer output from fitting a least squares regression line to the data is shown below. Dependent variable is: % of  3-Pointers Made $R^2 = 91.24\\%$ $S=0.052$ Variable: Coefficient s.e Coeff t-ratio prob Constant: 30.1 20 1.505 .075 Practice Time 0.002 0.000849 2.356 0.03 Is there sufficient evidence to suggest that there is a positive linear relationship between practice time and % of three-pointers made at the $5$ % significance level?  Assume the conditions for inference are met",
