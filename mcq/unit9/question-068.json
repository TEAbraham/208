  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">An NBA basketball player is interested if there is an association between the amount of time a player practices his three-point shooting (in hours) and the percentage of three pointers made.  Since the NBA player took AP Statistics in high school,  he knew of a perfect way to design his study and share it with his  NBA friends.  He randomly selected  <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$20$</span> NBA players and asked them how much time they spent practicing shooting behind the arc (shooting 3 pointers).  He then looked up their three-point percentage.  A computer output from fitting a least squares regression line to the data is shown below.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Dependent variable is: % of  3-Pointers Made    </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$R^2 = 91.24\\%$</span><br><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$S=0.052$</span>\n<br>  </div><div class=\"markdown-table-wrapper\"><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Variable:</th><th scope=\"col\">Coefficient</th><th scope=\"col\">s.e Coeff</th><th scope=\"col\">t-ratio</th><th scope=\"col\">prob</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Constant:</td><td>30.1</td><td>20</td><td>1.505</td><td>.075</td></tr><tr><td>Practice Time</td><td>0.002</td><td>0.000849</td><td>2.356</td><td>0.03</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><div class=\"paragraph\"><br>Is there sufficient evidence to suggest that there is a positive linear relationship between practice time and % of three-pointers made at the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span>% significance level?
