  "question_text": "An NBA basketball player is interested if there is an association between the amount of time a player practices his three-point shooting (in hours) and the percentage of three pointers made. Since the NBA player took AP Statistics in high school, he knew of a perfect way to design his study and share it with his NBA friends. He randomly selected $20$ NBA players and asked them how much time they spent practicing shooting behind the arc (shooting 3 pointers). He then looked up their three-point percentage. A computer output from fitting a least squares regression line to the data is shown below.<br>Dependent variable is: % of 3-Pointers Made<br>$R^2 = 91.24\\%$\n$S=0.052$<br>Is there sufficient evidence to suggest that there is a positive linear relationship between practice time and % of three-pointers made at the $5$% significance level? Assume the conditions for inference are met.",
