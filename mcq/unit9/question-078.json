  "question_text": "Snow making depends on temperature, since water freezes at $32^{\\circ} F$. Dave, a snow-making enthusiast, believes that there is no relationship between air temperature and $\\%$ relative humidity. He collected and analyzed data on the wet-bulb temperature which relates air temperature to $\\%$ relative humidity.<br>The conditions for regression inference were met and the following $98\\%$ confidence interval for $\\beta$, the slope of the population regression line of $\\%$ relative humidity on air temperature, was constructed:<br>$$(-10.77,-6.355)$$<br>Does this interval provide convincing evidence of a linear relationship between air temperature and $\\%$ relative humidity at the $\\alpha=0.02$ significance level?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe $\\alpha$-level is directly related to the $100-C$ level of confidence. Thus, an $\\alpha$-level of $0.02\\%$ is directly related to a $98\\%$-Confidence Interval.\n\nSince Dave \"...believes that there is no relationship between air temperature and % relative humidity\", he has set the null hypothesis of a two sided test at H0:β=0, with the alternative HA:β≠0. Thus, the 98% confidence interval is constructed under the assumption that there is no linear relationship.\n\nSince 0 is NOT included in the interval, we can reject \"no relationship\" in favor of the alternative, there is a linear relationship between air temperature and % relative humidity.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect.\n\nThe α level refers to the acceptable \"simply by chance variation\" threshold. As it relates to confidence intervals, α=100−C level of confidence. Thus, an α-level of 0.02% is directly related to a 98%-Confidence Interval.\n\nComparing the magnitude of β\nwith the α\n-level is comparing apples to oranges. Instead the wise analyst seeks whether or not the hypthesized β\nlies within the confidence interval.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect.\n\nThe α\nlevel refers to the acceptable \"simply by chance variation\" threshold. As it relates to confidence intervals, α=100−C\nlevel of confidence. Thus, an α\n-level of 0.02%\nis directly related to a 98%\n-Confidence Interval.\n\nComparing the magnitude of β\nwith the α\n-level is comparing apples to oranges. Instead the wise analyst seeks whether or not the hypthesized β\nlies within the confidence interval\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake made here is answering \"no\". The justification that 0\nis not included in the confidence interval is evidence against the null hypothesis, that there is no linear relationship. We should use this evidence to reject H0\nin favor of HA\n, that there is a linear relationship between air temperature and %\nrelative humidity.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect.\n\nConfidence intervals can be used for two-sided significance tests on β\nwithout adjustment to α\n. Simply look for β=β0\nto lie within the confidence interval. If it does not, reject H0\nin favor of HA\n.",
