He applied $4$ levels of treatment, each to $4$ sections of his lawn at random, and recorded the change in crabgrass plants per square meter. The data is given below:\nRegression analysis was performed and a $98\\%$ confidence interval for the slope of the true regression line of change in crabgrass on treatment was constructed.<br>$98\\%$ Confidence Interval: $ (-1.134, -0.8364)$<br>Interpret the meaning of this interval in context.",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nA level C\nconfidence interval means that if the experiment were repeated many times under the same methods, approximately C%\nof the resulting intervals would capture the true parameter in question.\n\nThus, we can say that we are 98%\nthe interval from −1.134\nto −0.8364\ncrabgrass plants per square meter captures the slope of the true regression line relating change in crabgrass and herbicide/fertilizer.\n\nSo, Choice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect.\n\nThis incorrect interpretation is made as if the parameter is a population mean. The inference procedure is about slope which involves both variables, change in crab grass and herbicide/fertilizer applied.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect.\n\nThis incorrect interpretation assumes that true regression slope depends on the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.\n\nSince the confidence interval is a combination of the slope point-estimate and the margin of error, the process used can be expected to generate intervals within which the true slope lies approximately\n98\n%\nof the time.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect.\n\nThis incorrect interpretation assumes that true regression slope depends on the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval.\n\nSince the confidence interval is a combination of the slope point-estimate and the margin of error, the process used can be expected to generate intervals within which the true slope lies approximately\n98\n%\nof the time.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake here is two-fold. The interval was interpreted as a mean number of crab grass plants killed and the\n98\n%\nas a proportion of effective treatment locations. Neither of these is correct.",
