He applied $4$ levels of treatment, each to $4$ sections of his lawn at random, and recorded the change in crabgrass plants per square meter. The data is given below:\nLoading question supplement...\nRegression analysis was performed and a $98\\%$ confidence interval for the slope of the true regression line of change in crabgrass on treatment was constructed.<br>$98\\%$ Confidence Interval: $ (-1.134, -0.8364)$<br>Interpret the meaning of this interval in context.",
