  "question_text": "Rob applied preventative herbicide/fertilizer to stop crabgrass in his lawn. He applied $4$ levels of treatment, each to $4$ sections of his lawn at random, and recorded the change in crabgrass plants per square meter. The data is given below:\nRegression analysis was performed and a $98\\%$ confidence interval for the slope of the true regression line of change in crabgrass on treatment was constructed.\n$98\\%$ Confidence Interval: $ (-1.134, -0.8364)$\nInterpret the meaning of this interval in context.",
