Twenty-nine people were randomly chosen, had their gas tanks filled, and then were asked to drive their cars until empty. The following summary data was collected:\nPredictor Coef SE Coef T P\nConstant $148.6$ $1.256$ $4.05$ $0.0000$\nGas tank $11.56$ $1.769$ $5.11$ $0.0000$\nAssuming all conditions have been verified, construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the slope and write an interpretation of your results.",
