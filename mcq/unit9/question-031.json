  "question_text": "A study was done to examine gas tank size (in gallons) and miles driven.  Twenty-nine people were randomly chosen, had their gas tanks filled, and then were asked to drive their cars until empty.  The following summary data was collected: Predictor Coef SE Coef T P Constant $148.6$ $1.256$ $4.05$ $0.0000$ Gas tank $11.56$ $1.769$ $5.11$ $0.0000$ Assuming all conditions have been verified, construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the slope and write an interpretation of your results.",
