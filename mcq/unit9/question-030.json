  "title": "Starting Salary vs College GPA",
  "difficulty": "Difficult",
  "question_text": "Sixty-five random recent college graduates were selected and asked their college grade point average (GPA) as well as their starting salary on their first job.  This resulted in a a regression equation of $\\hat{y}=9.7x + 23.6$ where $x$ is GPA and $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted salary (in thousands of dollars). The standard error was $0.25$ . Find a $99\\%$ confidence interval for the slope and interpret it.",
