  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">In February of 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) reached a low not seen in 10 years. Since then, the Dow Jones has been steadily increasing. Analysts have been studying the relationship between the highs of the Dow Jones for each year since 2009.
