  "question_text": "In February of 2009, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) reached a low not seen in 10 years. Since then, the Dow Jones has been steadily increasing. Analysts have been studying the relationship between the highs of the Dow Jones for each year since 2009. A computer regression analysis of the data is given below:<br>Dependent variable is: Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI)\n$R^2 = 93.33\\%$\n$s= 1116.14$ with $6-2= 4$ D.O.F.<br>Assuming all of the conditions have been satisfied, which of the following is a correct interpretation of \"$90\\%$ confidence\" for the slope in this problem (assume the interval we constructed from data is $(c,d)$)?<br>Assuming all of the conditions have been satisfied, which of the following is a correct interpretation of \"$90\\%$ confidence\" for the slope in this problem (assume the interval we constructed from data is $(c,d)$)?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The purpose of a confidence interval is to capture the population parameter, which in this case is the population slope.\n\nWhen answering this, you should look for something that mentions true slope, population slope, or has an interpretation of slope with the word average (predicted) in it. By process of elimination, we can eliminate Choices 'B', 'C', and 'E', since none of them mention any of these phrases.\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect, as the probability that the true slope is in the interval is either $0$ or $1$ and not $.90$. The reasoning behind this is that the true slope is a fixed value (does not change), so it is either in the interval ($100\\%$ probability) or not in the interval ($0\\%$ probability).\n\nChoice 'D' is the correct answer as this is the definition of a confidence level.",
