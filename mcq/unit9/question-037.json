  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn doing a $t$-test for slope in a regression model, a similar approach to hypotheses is used as with other tests of significance. Instead of using $p$ or $\\mu$, here we use $\\beta$, beta, which is the population value of the slope for the regression line.\n\nThe null hypothesis is what is assumed to be true. While it is possible to assume a given slope, it is more common to test for an association between the variables by assuming that there is none in the first place. So, in this case we would set $\\beta$ equal to zero. Whether zero or another slope value is used, the null hypothesis always uses an equals sign.\n\nThe alternative hypothesis is what we want to prove to be true. Here we set $\\beta$ to be less than, greater than, or not equal to zero or some other value. The sign is chosen based on the wording in the question. If not clearly less than or greater than, or one-sided, then a two-sided test should be used with a not equal to sign used.\n\nSo, Choice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because a $>$ sign is used instead of an $=$ sign.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because a $<$ sign is used instead of an $=$ sign.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the letter $b$ is used instead of a $\\beta$; the population variable should be used. Also, there is a $\\neq$ used instead of an $=$ sign.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because the letter $b$ is used instead of a $\\beta$; the population variable should be used.",
