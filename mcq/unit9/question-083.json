  "question_text": "Michael travels around the world learning about cuisine and local fishing. A particular area of Canadian water is known to have large quantities of lake trout, but Michael has been unable to catch any. The local fishermen advise him that they believe there is a relationship between falling atmospheric pressure and lake trout feeding activity. As it seems, fish catches rise as the pressure falls.<br>Michael, ever the analyst, collects pressure readings from historical weather data for the past year and plots each drop in pressure against the Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) lake trout catch data for the area of interest. He believes that the locals are correct.<br>Michael forms the following hypotheses, and wishes to test at the $\\alpha=0.01$ level of significance:<br>$H_0$: There is no linear relationship between negative pressure change and the number of lake trout caught in the specific area of interest in Canadian water.<br>$H_A$: There is a negative linear relationship between negative pressure change and the number of lake trout caught in the specific area of interest in Canadian water.<br>What test is appropriate for this inference procedure?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is correct.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nWhen the conditions for regression are met, the correct procedure is a $t_{n-2}$ test for the slope of the true regression line.\n\nThough not an option given here, it is also acceptable to construct a $100-\\frac{\\alpha}{2}$ confidence interval for $\\beta$, the slope, and reject $H_0$ if $\\beta_0$ is not within the confidence interval.\n\nSo, Choice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect.\n\nThere are two errors in this choice: First, since a point estimate is used and no parameter for standard deviation is known, a $t$-distribution must be used, not a $z$-distribution.\n\nSecond, naming degrees of freedom for a $z$-distribution is unwarranted since there is only one standard normal distribution.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect.\n\nThere are two errors in this choice: First, since a point estimate is used and no parameter for standard deviation is known, a $t$-distribution must be used, not a $z$-distribution.\n\nSecond, naming degrees of freedom for a $z$-distribution is unwarranted since there is only one standard normal distribution.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect.\n\nWhile the correct statistic, $t$, is chosen, the incorrect degrees of freedom is identified. Since each degree of freedom corresponds to a different $t$-distribution curve, identifying the incorrect $df$ will result in erroneous $p$-values, and potential incorrect inference conclusion(s).\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect.\n\nWhile the correct statistic, $t$, and degrees of freedom are identified, the incorrect statistic was chosen. Since the hypotheses revolve around the relationship between Negative Pressure Change and Quantity of Lake Trout Caught, the inference procedure should be a $t$ test with $n-2$ degrees of freedom for the the slope of the true regression line of Lake Trout Caught on Negative Pressure Change.",
