  "question_text": "An owner of a local ice cream shop wishes to determine if a positive linear relationship exists between high temperatures and the shopâ€™s profits recorded that day. The owner recorded sales from the last $50\\text{ days}$ of the summer and performed a linear regression $T$ -interval on temperature vs. sales at $95\\%$ confidence. If the interval extends from $50.2$ to $76.2$ , which of the following statements is/are true? I. Strong evidence exists $(p < 0.05)$ of a linear relationship between these variables. II. The model predicts an extra $\\$63.20$ in sales for every extra degree the temperature rises. III. In this situation specifically, extrapolation is probably safe.",
