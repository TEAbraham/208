  "question_text": "An owner of a local ice cream shop wishes to determine if a positive linear relationship exists between high temperatures and the shopâ€™s profits recorded that day.\nThe owner recorded sales from the last $50\\text{ days}$ of the summer and performed a linear regression $T$-interval on temperature vs. sales at $95\\%$ confidence.\nIf the interval extends from $50.2$ to $76.2$, which of the following statements is/are true?\nI. Strong evidence exists $(p < 0.05)$ of a linear relationship between these variables.\nII. The model predicts an extra $\\$63.20$ in sales for every extra degree the temperature rises.\nIII. In this situation specifically, extrapolation is probably safe.",
