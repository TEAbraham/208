  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "A statistician wanted to construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the population slope between height (in inches) and weight (in pounds) of his co-workers. He made height the explanatory (independent) variable and weight the response (dependent) variable.<br>He selected a random sample of $30$ people from work and asked them to list their height and weight. After seeing his conditions were satisfied, he constructed the interval.<br>Which of the following would he use for the critical value?",

  "solution": "The critical value (t∗), when calculating a slope t-interval, has degrees of freedom n−2, where n is the sample size. In this case, the degrees of freedom is: 30−2=28.\n\nOn the t-distribution chart, find where 95% confidence and 28 degrees of freedom intersect.\n\nExplanation of Distractors Choice 'A' is incorrect as this is the critical value for a z-interval of 95% confidence. Choice 'B' is incorrect as this would be the critical value for 32 degrees of freedom and 95% confidence. Choice 'C' is incorrect as this would be the critical value for 30 degrees of freedom and 95% confidence. Choice 'D' is incorrect as this would be the critical value for 29 degrees of freedom and 95% confidence.",
