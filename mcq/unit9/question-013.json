  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "A statistician wanted to construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the population slope between height (in inches) and weight (in pounds) of his co-workers. He made height the explanatory (independent) variable and weight the response (dependent) variable. He selected a random sample of $30$ people from work and asked them to list their height and weight. After seeing his conditions were satisfied, he constructed the interval. Which of the following would he use for the critical value?",
