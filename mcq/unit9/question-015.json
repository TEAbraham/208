A random sample of $26$ women had their body fat percentage measured and were also were asked how much chocolate they eat a day. A computer regression analysis of the data is given below:\nDependent variable is: Body fat\n$R^2 = 20.26\\%$\n$s= 7.89 $\nVariable Coefficient s.e Coeff t-ratio prob\nConstant 23.231 1.567 14.32 0.00001\nChocolate 0.0543 0.0217 2.21 0.037\n\n\nAssuming the conditions have been satisfied and using $95\\%$ confidence, which of the following represents the point estimate for the slope $t$-interval?",
