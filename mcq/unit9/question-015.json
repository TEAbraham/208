  "solution": "The formula for a slope regression t\n-interval is:\n\nb±(t\n∗\nn−2\n⋅S.E.b)\n\n...where the point estimate is the content before the ±\n, which in this case is b\n, or the sample slope.\n\nThe sample slope (b\n) is given in the table. It is the coefficient of the x\n-variable, which in this case is the coefficient of the chocolate. Looking at this value in the table, we can see that it is 0.0543\n.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as\n0.0217\nrepresents the standard error of the slope. Choice 'C' is incorrect as\n1.567\nrepresents the standard error of the y-intercept. Choice 'D' is incorrect as\n7.89\nrepresents the standard deviation of the residuals. Choice 'E' is incorrect as\n23.231\nrepresents the value for the y-intercept.",
