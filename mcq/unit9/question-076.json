  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "In the warm summer months, crab grass proliferates and sets seed. Because it is unsightly, many homeowners attempt to interrupt the crabgrass cycle with \"preventer\" herbicide/fertilizers that inhibit germination.\nRob decided to apply $4$ different levels of the same treatment chemical to his lawn in $16$ total random sections. He then counted and recorded the difference in number of crab grass plants in each treatment area before and after treatment. A linear regression analysis was run, and the residuals for the $16$ data points are listed below.\nUse the residual data to estimate $\\sigma$, the variability of the change in crabgrass about the true regression line.",
