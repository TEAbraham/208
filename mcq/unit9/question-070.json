  "question_text": "Marty McMath wants to know if a student's final grade in Algebra II can be used to predict his or her final grade in Precalculus. To investigate, he gathers data from a random sample of $8$ students who have completed both courses. After noticing that the relationship is roughly linear and confirming that the conditions have been satisfied, he decides to use statistical software to conduct a $2$ -sided $t$ -test for linear regression where the null hypothesis is the slope equals $0$ . Computer output is shown below. Predictor Coef SE Coef T Constant 16.46 3.73 4.41 Algebra II 0.82 0.22 3.73 Unfortunately, he can't figure out how to make the computer output display the $p$ -value. Luckily, he knows enough statistics to be able to calculate it from the output shown. What is the $p$ -value?",
