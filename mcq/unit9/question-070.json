  "question_text": "Marty McMath wants to know if a student's final grade in Algebra II can be used to predict his or her final grade in Precalculus. To investigate, he gathers data from a random sample of $8$ students who have completed both courses.\nAfter noticing that the relationship is roughly linear and confirming that the conditions have been satisfied, he decides to use statistical software to conduct a $2$-sided $t$-test for linear regression where the null hypothesis is the slope equals $0$.\nComputer output is shown below.\nPredictor Coef SE Coef T\nConstant 16.46 3.73 4.41\nAlgebra II 0.82 0.22 3.73\n\n\nUnfortunately, he can't figure out how to make the computer output display the $p$-value. Luckily, he knows enough statistics to be able to calculate it from the output shown.\nWhat is the $p$-value?",
