To investigate, he gathers data from a random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8$</span> students who have completed both courses.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">After noticing that the relationship is roughly linear and confirming that the conditions have been satisfied, he decides to use statistical software to conduct a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2$</span>-sided <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$t$</span>-test for linear regression where the null hypothesis is the slope equals <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Computer output is shown below.\n<br>  </div><div class=\"markdown-table-wrapper\"><table><thead><tr><th scope=\"col\">Predictor</th><th scope=\"col\">Coef</th><th scope=\"col\">SE Coef</th><th scope=\"col\">T</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Constant</td><td>16.46</td><td>3.73</td><td>4.41</td></tr><tr><td>Algebra II</td><td>0.82</td><td>0.22</td><td>3.73</td></tr></tbody></table></div><br><div class=\"paragraph\"><br>Unfortunately, he can't figure out how to make the computer output display the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p$</span>-value.
