  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "Jessica was stuck babysitting and was feeling quite bored from watching her little sister Allison bounce a ball up and down. To ease her boredom she decided to keep track of the number of bounces Allison could complete in various amounts of time.<br>She then developed the equation for the least squares regression line to be:<br>$$\\hat { y } = 2.136+1.021x$$<br>...where $\\hat { y }$ is the predicted number of bounces and $x$ is the number of seconds.<br>If the standard error of the slope is $0.763$, what $t$-statistic would Jessica arrive at when completing a $t$-test for the linear regression?",

  "solution": "The $t$-value can be calculated using the following formula:\n\n$$t=\\dfrac { { b }_{ 1 } }{ SE }$$\n\n...where ${ b }_{ 1 }$ is the slope of the least-squares regression line and $SE$ is the standard error of the slope.\n\nFilling in the formula:\n\n$$t = \\dfrac { 1.021 }{ 0.763 } =1.338$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and was calculated by reversing the numerator and denominator in the $t$-statistic.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect and represents only the standard error of the slope.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect and represents the actual slope of the least-squares regression line.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It was calculated by mistaking the $y$-intercept from the least-squares regression for the slope.",
