  "question_text": "Jessica was stuck babysitting and was feeling quite bored from watching her little sister Allison bounce a ball up and down. To ease her boredom she decided to keep track of the number of bounces Allison could complete in various amounts of time.<br>She then developed the equation for the least squares regression line to be:<br>$$\\hat { y } = 2.136+1.021x$$<br>...where $\\hat { y }$ is the predicted number of bounces and $x$ is the number of seconds.<br>If the standard error of the slope is $0.763$, what $t$-statistic would Jessica arrive at when completing a $t$-test for the linear regression?",
