She selected a random sample of $20$ students from the large class and asked \"How long did you study for your previous test?\".<br>Then she plotted the time studied versus the score on the test. Given is the computer output for the linear regression model for the data:<br>What is the estimated slope of the regression model for sample of $20$ students?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe college professor inputted her data into a computer program and created a computer output for the data. The computer output gives numerous data points that provide information for linear regression, as well as for inference for linear regression.\n\nFinding the necessary information is the key to finding the correct answer to the problem. The slope of the linear regression model is located at the intersection of \"Time Studied\" and \"Coef\" on the table below:\n\nTherefore, the estimated slope for the regression model for $20$ students is $0.0650$\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. $65.03$ is the estimated y-intercept for the regression model.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. $4.03$ is the standard deviation of the residuals, not the slope.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. $0.882$ is the $r$ squared value, which is the coefficient of determination for the regression model.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. $0.0023$ is the Standard Error of the slope, which has previously been ignored, but will be used in Unit $9$.",
