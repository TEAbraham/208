Then these $25\\text{ subjects}$ are put into an extensive review course. After the review course, the subjects took the test once more.<br>A linear regression $T$-test is performed on<br>$$H_0: B = 0 \\\\ H_a: B>0$$<br>Define B as the true slope of the linear regression line when plotting pre-test vs. post-test scores.<br>If $p<0.01$, one could conclude",
