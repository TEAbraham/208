  "question_text": "Suppose researchers want to know if a positive linear relationship exists between pre- and post-test scores on the test. Twenty-five students are given the test as a pre-test. Then these $25\\text{ subjects}$ are put into an extensive review course. After the review course, the subjects took the test once more. A linear regression $T$ -test is performed on $$H_0: B = 0  \\\\\nH_a: B>0$$ Define B as the true slope of the linear regression line when plotting pre-test vs. post-test scores. If $p<0.01$ , one could conclude",
