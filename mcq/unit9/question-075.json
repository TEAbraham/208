  "question_text": "Ryan sails his sunfish sailboat every Sunday between Memorial Day and Labor Day. In the off-season, he decided to analyze historical weather data in an attempt to predict the wind speed from changes in atmospheric pressure. Ryan took a random sample of $16$ negative pressure changes during the $24$ hours leading up to race time, and the subsequent average wind speed during the regatta. The data is listed below:<br>Construct a $98\\%$-confidence interval for the slope of the true regression line of wind speed on negative pressure change.",

  "solution": "**Solution**\n\nTo construct a confidence interval for the slope of a regression line, we must verify the conditions.\n\nLinear: The scatterplot of wind speed on negative pressure change shows a clear linear form. The residual plot shows random scatter about the line $y=0$.\n\nIndependent: It is stated that Ryan chose a random selection of negative pressure change. Since pressure tends to drop during foul weather, we can assume that each pressure change was a result of a unique weather system. Thus knowing information about one pressure change should not help predict any other.\n\nNormal: The histogram of the residuals is questionable. A single peak and bell-shape are not clearly evident, but the small number of observations and lack of clear violations allow us to proceed.\n\nEqual Standard Deviation: The residual plot shows a similar amount of scatter above and below the line $y=0$ for the data set of negative pressure changes.\n\nRandom: It is stated that Ryan chose a random selection of negative pressure change.\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is correct.\n\nUsing TI-84:\n\nSTAT > TESTS > LinRegTInt\n\nXlist: L1\n\nYlist: L2\n\nFreq: 1\n\nC-Level: .98\n\nRegEQ: Y1\n\nCalculate\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake made here is treating the wind speed as the explanatory variable and the negative pressure change as the response.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake made here is computing the point estimate for slope. To correctly identify the $98\\%$-confidence interval, simply subtract the margin of error from the point estimate to obtain the lower bound, and add the margin of error from the point estimate to obtain the upper bound.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect.\n\nThe mistake made here is computing a $95\\%$-confidence interval.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect.\n\nThis mistake made here is computing a $99\\%$-confidence interval.",
