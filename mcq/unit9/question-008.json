  "question_text": "The producers of a famous reality show (a show where the contestants do not have much food to eat) are wondering if they can approximate the weight lost for a contestant during their time on the show. The producers select a random sample of $20$ former contestants and use this data to create a linear regression model and a confidence interval for the slope of the regression line. The confidence interval is as follows:<br>($-8.23, -2.45$)<br>Do the producers have convincing evidence that contestants will lose weight on their time on the show?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe producers are interested in creating a confidence interval that produces a range of possible values for the slope of the regression model for the predicted weight loss of the population of all contestants on the reality show. When the producers found their interval, the bounds ($-8.23, -2.45$) were both negative numbers. This is implying that the possible range of slopes is between $-8.23$ and $-2.45$.\n\nSince both bounds of the interval are negative, and $0$ is not a plausible value for the slope, there is convincing evidence that the contestants will lose weight when on the show.\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Since the producers created a confidence interval and not a significance test, there is not a p-value provided, therefore we cannot compare these values to the alpha level.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. When doing inference for slopes of regression lines, sample size does not necessarily matter. Therefore, the sample size of $20$ is large enough.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Even though the producers did not create a significance test, they can still use the confidence interval to determine convincing evidence as long as the bounds have the same signs, in this case negative.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since the producers selected a random sample from the show, we can generalize the data for the entire population.",
