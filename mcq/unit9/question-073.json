  "question_text": "The population of squirrels is regulated by, among other things, natural predators such as coyotes, foxes, hawks, and owls. It is known that higher density populations generally result in higher proportions of squirrels eaten by predators.<br>A recent study observed the density of squirrels in a random selection of $4$ towns over the summer months and recorded the proportion of squirrels eaten. The explanatory variable is the density of the squirrel population in a particular town. The response variable is the proportion of the population consumed by predators. The data is shown below.\nLoading question supplement...<br>A regression analysis is performed for these data and the scatterplot and residual plot are shown below.<br>For what reason(s) is inference about the regression model NOT met?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn examining the residual plot, it should be clear that the proportion of squirrels consumed is not normally distributed for each population density. Since there are only three data points for each density level, normality cannot be approximated.\n\nThe scatterplot shows a relatively linear pattern, and there is no clear nonlinear pattern in the residual plot. Thus i is satisfied.\n\nThe residual plot shows a similar variation in the proportion of squirrels consumed for each population density. Thus ii is satisfied.\n\nSo, Choice 'C'is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect.\n\nSince the scatterplot shows a relatively linear pattern, and there is no clear nonlinear pattern in the residual plot, i is satisfied.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect.\n\nSince the residual plot shows similar variation in the proportion of squirrels consumed for each population density, ii is satisfied.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect.\n\nThough the residual plot shows similar variation in the proportion of squirrels consumed for each population density, the proportion of squirrels consumed is not normally distributed for each population density. Since there are only three data points for each density level, normality cannot be approximated.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect.\n\nSince the scatterplot shows a relatively linear pattern, and there is no clear nonlinear pattern in the residual plot, the linear condition is satisfied.\n\nSince the spread of proportion of population consumed is approximately the same for each population density, the equal standard deviations condition is satisfied.\n\nIt is stated that the data were collected from randomly chosen towns, and we can assume that the sample represents less than $10\\%$ of the squirrel population, the independence condition is satisfied.\n\nThe Normal condition is the only one not satisfied because the $3$ data points show skewed patterns and at least $30$ is required to proceed when skewness is present.",
