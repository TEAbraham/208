  "question_text": "The population of squirrels is regulated by, among other things, natural predators such as coyotes, foxes, hawks, and owls. It is known that higher density populations generally result in higher proportions of squirrels eaten by predators.<br>A recent study observed the density of squirrels in a random selection of $4$ towns over the summer months and recorded the proportion of squirrels eaten. The explanatory variable is the density of the squirrel population in a particular town. The response variable is the proportion of the population consumed by predators. The data is shown below.\nLoading question supplement...<br>A regression analysis is performed for these data and the scatterplot and residual plot are shown below.<br>For what reason(s) is inference about the regression model NOT met?",
