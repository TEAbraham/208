  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "A statistician wanted to construct a $95\\%$ confidence interval for the population slope between height (in inches) and weight (in pounds) of his co-workers. He made height the explanatory (independent) variable and weight the response (dependent) variable.<br>He selected a random sample of $30$ people from work and asked them to list their height and weight. After seeing his conditions were satisfied, he constructed the interval and got a result of $(1.97, 2.89)$.<br>Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the interval in the context of this study?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The purpose of a confidence interval is to capture the population parameter, which in this case is the population slope. When answering this you should look for something that mentions true slope, population slope, or has an interpretation of slope with the word average (predicted) in it.\n\nBy process of elimination, we can eliminate Choices 'C' and 'D', since none of them mention these phrases.\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect, as the probability that the true slope is in the interval is either 0\nor 1\n. The reasoning behind this is the true slope is a fixed value (doesn't change), so it is either in the interval (100%\nprobability) or not in the interval (0%\nprobability). The true slope can't be in the interval 95%\nof the time.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect, because the slope is interpreted incorrectly in this case. It should say that for each additional increase in height, the average weight will increase between 1.97\nto 2.89\n, since weight is the response variable (y\n-variable) and height is the explanatory variable (x\n-variable).",
