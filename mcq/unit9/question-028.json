He made height the explanatory (independent) variable and weight the response (dependent) variable.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">He selected a random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$30$</span> people from work and asked them to list their height and weight. After seeing his conditions were satisfied, he constructed the interval and got a result of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$(1.97, 2.89)$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the interval in the context of this study?</div>",
