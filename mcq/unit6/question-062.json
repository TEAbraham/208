Later, he realized that while he had correctly computed the sample proportion (which was larger than his hypothesized proportion), he had incorrectly recorded the sample size when calculating the standard error.  In reality, the actual sample size was smaller than the sample size he had used in his calculation.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">If Miguel revises his calculation of standard error to decrease the sample size, which of the following describes the effect upon the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$z$</span>-statistic and the corresponding <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p$</span>-value?</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Note: his alternative hypothesis is that <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p &gt; p_0$</span></div>",
