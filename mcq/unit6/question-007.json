  "correct_answer": "<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is the correct answer. ",
  "solution": "After looking at many, many shipments for grapes for the large retailer, the manager is essentially looking at a <strong>sampling distribution</strong> of the packages of grapes that are rotten. When examining the sampling distribution, the manager can find the probability if and only if the distribution meets the <strong>Large Counts</strong> condition, which is used to assess the normality of the approximation of sampling distribution. \n\nTherefore, the manager must find out if the approximation of the sampling distribution is approximately normal in order to find the probability. \n\n<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is correct.

    "D": "<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is incorrect. The variables that are causing the grapes to be rotten is definitely important, but it will not affect the probability of the grapes being rotten. ",
    "E": "<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is incorrect. Since the store already knows the approximate proportion of grapes of their stores shipments that are rotten, they do not need to know the proportion of the population of packages that are rotten."
