  "question_text": "Travis recently heard a report claiming that $35\\%$ of young adults have at least one tattoo. He thinks that the actual percentage is lower for students at his university. To investigate, he randomly selects $60\\text{ students}$ from his university and finds that $17$ of them have at least one tattoo.<br>Assuming that all conditions have been satisfied, what is the $p$-value for the appropriate significance test?",

  "solution": "We should conduct a one-sample $z$-test for proportions with the following hypotheses:\n\n$H_0: p = 0.35$\n$H_a: p < 0.35$\n\n...where $p$ is the proportion of students at this university who have at least one tattoo.\n\nSince we are assuming our conditions to be satisfied, we proceed to calculating the $p$-value. We begin by calculating the $z$-score related to our observation.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac { \\hat { p } - p }{ \\sqrt { \\dfrac { \\left( p \\right) \\left( 1-p \\right) }{ n } } }$$\n\nFilling in the formula, we find:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac { \\dfrac { 17 }{ 60 } - 0.35 }{ \\sqrt { \\dfrac { \\left( 0.35 \\right) \\left( 1-0.35 \\right) }{ 60 } } } = -1.083$$\n\nOur alternative hypothesis is in the less than direction, so now we need to find $p(z < -1.083)$. To do this, we can use our TI83/84 graphing calculator's normalcdf function. The syntax is: normalcdf(lower bound, upper bound, mean, standard deviation).\n\nSince we have calculated a $z$-score, we are working from the standard normal distribution whose mean is $0$ and the standard deviation is $1$.\n\nTherefore, we would:\n\nNote: on a free-response problem it is very important to show all of your work. However, on a multiple choice problem of this nature, you can find the $p$-value directly using your TI83/84 graphing calculator.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\nThe calculator will return the $z$ value of $z = -1.083$ and a $p$-value of $p = 0.14$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect and represents the $p$-value for a two-sided alternative hypothesis. Alternatively, it could represent the observed proportion.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as it simply represents the assumed proportion from the null hypothesis.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. It is the complement of Choice 'B'. That is, $1 – 0.28 = 0.72$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It is the complement of the correct answer. That is, $1 – 0.14 = 0.86$.",
