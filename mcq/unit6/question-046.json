This compares higher than the national average of $39\\%$ of people who do not brush their teeth twice a day.<br>If one wants to see if college kids are significantly less likely to brush their teeth, what would be appropriate null and alternative hypotheses for this study?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Since this problem deals with proportions, one must use the symbol $p$ rather than $\\mu$.\n\nThe null hypothesis, $H_0$, is a statement of status quo. This means that the proportion of college kids who brush their teeth is $39\\%$, which is no different than everybody else.\n\nThe problem states, however, that itâ€™s possible a higher proportion of college kids do not brush their teeth twice daily. Therefore, it makes sense to have the alternative hypothesis, $H_a$ be $p > 0.39$.\n\nNever state hypotheses in terms of values taken from the sample or samples.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
