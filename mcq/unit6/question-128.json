  "question_text": "A group of college students in a psychology class wonders if the order of treatments changes the outcome of a study. To test this, they ask students in a blind taste test which of two colas they prefer, Pepsi or Coke. In this blind taste test, the first $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Pepsi and then Coke, with $34$ preferring Pepsi. The next $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Coke and then Pepsi, with $29$ preferring Pepsi. Does this give evidence that the order in which colas, or options, are presented makes a difference? Determine the approximate $p$ -value of a test to answer this question.",
