  "question_text": "A group of college students in a psychology class wonders if the order of treatments changes the outcome of a study.<br>To test this, they ask students in a blind taste test which of two colas they prefer, Pepsi or Coke. In this blind taste test, the first $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Pepsi and then Coke, with $34$ preferring Pepsi. The next $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Coke and then Pepsi, with $29$ preferring Pepsi.<br>Does this give evidence that the order in which colas, or options, are presented makes a difference?<br>Determine the approximate $p$-value of a test to answer this question.",

  "solution": "Find the test statistic by using a TI-83/84 calculator to see $z = 1.04$ or use the formula below where:\n\n${ p }_{ 1 }= \\dfrac{34}{50} = 0.68$\n${ p }_{ 2 }= \\dfrac{29}{50} = 0.58$\n${ n }_{ 1 }= 50$\n${ n }_{ 2 }= 50$\n\n$$z= \\dfrac{\\hat{p_1} - \\hat{p_2}}{\\sqrt{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p}\\left(\\dfrac{1}{n_1} + \\dfrac{1}{n_2}\\right)}}$$\n\nPooled $\\hat{p} = \\dfrac{(34+29)}{(50+50)} = 0.63$\n\nUsing the standard normal table, $\\text{P(z >1.04)} = 0.1492$.\n\nSince this is a two-sided test, the $p$-value is $0.1492 \\cdot 2 = 0.2984$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.\n\nNote: On the AP test, the formula's listed are not given in their entirety. However, it is given on the test that a test statistic is found by:\n(statistic - parameter) / standard deviation of statistic. Furthermore, the standard deviation formula is given on the AP test as well. A student only needs to put the pieces together rather than simply memorize a formula.",
