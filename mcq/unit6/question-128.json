In this blind taste test, the first $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Pepsi and then Coke, with $34$ preferring Pepsi. The next $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Coke and then Pepsi, with $29$ preferring Pepsi.<br>Does this give evidence that the order in which colas, or options, are presented makes a difference?<br>Determine the approximate $p$-value of a test to answer this question.",
