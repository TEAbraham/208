  "question_text": "A company was offering a $30$-day trial on its new mattress product. The CEO of the company believed that the mattress would be successful as long as only $10\\%$ of its customers returned their mattresses. The owner of a large store was afraid that the percentage would be greater than this, so $80$ random customers were selected and it was found that $12$ of them returned their mattress. Was the product successful at a significance level of $0.05$?",
