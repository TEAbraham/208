This compares higher than the national average of $39\\%$.<br>The researcher decided to test the claim that college kids are more likely not to brush their teeth twice daily than the rest of the public, at the $\\alpha = 5\\%$ level.<br>What type of error could the researcher have made, and how could this error be described in the context of the problem?",
