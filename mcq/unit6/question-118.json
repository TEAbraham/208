  "question_text": "A group of college students in a psychology class wonders if the order of treatments changes the outcome of a study.<br>To test this, they ask students in a blind taste test which of two colas they prefer, Pepsi or Coke. In this blind taste test, the first $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Pepsi and then Coke, with $34$ preferring Pepsi. The next $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Coke and then Pepsi, with $29$ preferring Pepsi.<br>If the students wish to determine whether the order in which options are offered changes preferences, what would be an appropriate interval at $95\\%$ confidence?",

  "solution": "Use the following formula or a TI-83/84 calculator to construct a two-proportion Z-interval:\n\n(\n^\np1\n−\n^\np2\n)±z∗\n√\n^\np1\n(1−\n^\np1\n)\nn1\n+\n^\np2\n(1−\n^\np2\n)\nn2\n\nz∗=1.96\nusing the standard normal chart\n\nn1=50\n\nn2=50\n\np1=\n34\n50\n=0.68\n\np2=\n29\n50\n=0.58\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'\n\nNote: On the AP test, the formula's listed are not given in their entirety. However, it is given on the test that a confidence interval is constructed by the following:\n\nstatistic±( critical value⋅standard deviation of statistic)\n\nFurthermore, the standard deviation formula is given on the AP test as well. A student only needs to put the pieces together rather than simply memorize a formula.",
