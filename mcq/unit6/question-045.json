According to some reports $10\\%$ of people are left-handed, but Billy doesn't believe this is true and decides to do a study. He randomly selects $130$ people and finds that $20$ of them are left-handed.<br>What is the $p$-value for the appropriate significance test?",

  "solution": "We should conduct a one-sample $z$-test for proportions with the following hypotheses:\n\n$${ H }_{ 0 }: p = 0.10$$\n\n$${ H }_{ a }: p \\neq 0.10$$\n\n...where $p$ is the proportion of people who are left-handed. We are using a two-sided alternative hypothesis since there is no indication that Billy believes the true proportion is either higher or lower. He simply does not believe it is $0.10$.\n\nBefore beginning the test, we need to verify that the appropriate conditions have been satisfied. The conditions are:\n\nWe must have a random sample from our population of interest. We are told that Billy selects his sample randomly, so this condition is satisfied.\n\nThe population must be at least $10$ times as large as the sample size. Although we are not given a population size, it is logical to assume that the entire population of left handers is certainly more that $(10)(130) = 1300$ individuals. We can consider this condition to be satisfied.\n\n$np \\ge 10$, and $n\\left( 1-p \\right) \\ge 10$\n\n...where $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the proportion identified in the null hypothesis.\n\n$$(130)(0.10) = 13 \\ge 10$$\n\n$$ (130)(1-0.10) = 117 \\ge 10$$\n\nThis condition is also satisfied.\n\nNOTE: this condition is sometimes called the success/failure condition and says that we must expect at least $10$ successes (people who are left-handed) and $10$ failures (people who are not left-handed).\n\nSince our conditions are satisfied, we proceed to calculating the $p$-value. We begin by calculating the $z$-score related to our observation.\n\nThe formula is:\n\n$$z = \\frac { \\hat { p } - p }{ \\sqrt { \\dfrac { \\left( p \\right) \\left( 1-p \\right) }{ n } } }$$\n\nFilling in the formula, we find:\n\n$$z = \\frac { \\dfrac { 20 }{ 130 } - 0.10 }{ \\sqrt { \\dfrac { \\left( 0.10 \\right) \\left( 1-0.10 \\right) }{ 130 } } } = 2.077$$\n\nNow we need to find our $p$-value. To do this, we can use our TI83/84 graphing calculator's normalcdf function. The syntax is: normalcdf (lower bound, upper bound, mean, standard deviation).\n\nSince our $z$-score is positive we will use it as the lower bound. Also, since we have calculated a $z$-score, we are working from the standard normal distribution whose mean is $0$ and standard deviation is $1$.\n\nTherefore, we would:\n\nMultiply by $2$ to find the two-sided $p$-value of $(0.0189)(2) = 0.0378$ or about $0.04$.\n\nNOTE: on a free-response problem it is very important to show all of your work. However, on a multiple choice problem of this nature, you can find the $p$-value directly using your TI83/84 graphing calculator.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\nThe calculator will return the $z$-value of $2.046$ and the $p$-value of $p = 0.041$. Notice that these values are slightly different from those calculated above. This is simply the result of rounding.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect and represents the $p$-value for a one-sided alternative in the greater than direction.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This is our assumed value of $p$.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This is the sample proportion.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. As noted above, the conditions for completing this test were satisfied.",
