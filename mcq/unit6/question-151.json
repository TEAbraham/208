Random samples of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$400$</span> people on each coast were asked what the most important factor was in their decision.  On the East Coast, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$68$</span> people chose weather and on the West Coast, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$88$</span> people chose weather.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Blue Fin wanted to know if there was a difference in the proportions of choice of weather between people living on the East and West Coasts.  Given a significance level of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\alpha=0.05$</span>, determine the range of where the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p$</span>-value falls and whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are really the same.</div>",
