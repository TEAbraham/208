  "question_text": "Blue Fin Real Estate was interested in what prompted people to choose to live on either the East Coast or the West Coast. Random samples of $400$ people on each coast were asked what the most important factor was in their decision. On the East Coast, $68$ people chose weather and on the West Coast, $88$ people chose weather.<br>Blue Fin wanted to know if there was a difference in the proportions of choice of weather between people living on the East and West Coasts. Given a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$, determine the range of where the $p$-value falls and whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are really the same.",
