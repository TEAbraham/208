  "question_text": "Blue Fin Real Estate was interested in what prompted people to choose to live on either the East Coast or the West Coast. Random samples of $400$ people on each coast were asked what the most important factor was in their decision. On the East Coast, $68$ people chose weather and on the West Coast, $88$ people chose weather.<br>Blue Fin wanted to know if there was a difference in the proportions of choice of weather between people living on the East and West Coasts. Given a significance level of $\\alpha=0.05$, determine the range of where the $p$-value falls and whether or not we can reject the null hypothesis that the proportions are really the same.",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nTo find the p-value, we must first calculate the value of\nˆ\np\nc:\n\nˆ\np\nc=\nn1\nˆ\np\n1+n2\nˆ\np\n2\nn1+n2\n\n...where the\nˆ\np\nvalues are the two sample proportions,\n\nˆ\np\n1=\n68\n400\n=0.17\nand\nˆ\np\n2=\n88\n400\n=0.22\n, and the n\nvalues are both equal to 400\n.\n\nWe get:\n\nˆ\np\nc=\n(400)(0.17)+(400)(0.22)\n400+400\n=0.195\n\nThen, we plug in this value and the others we have found to find the test statistic, z\n:\n\n(\nˆ\np\n1−\nˆ\np\n2)−0\n√\nˆ\np\nc(1−\nˆ\np\nc)\n√\n1\nn1\n+\n1\nn2\n\nSo we get:\n\nz\n=\n(\n0.17\n−\n0.22\n)\n−\n0\n√\n0.195\n(\n1\n−\n0.195\n)\n√\n1\n400\n+\n1\n400\n=\n−\n1.78\n\nUsing Table B, we find that\n−\n1.78\nfalls between the\np\n-values of\n0.025\nand\n0.05\n, but because the question is\n2\n-sided, that is, looking for a difference and not whether one proportion is greater than the other, the\np\n-value must be doubled. Thus, we say that our\np\n-value falls between\n0.05\nand\n0.10\n.\n\nFinally, because our\np\n-value is greater than the given\nα\n=\n0.05\n, we fail to reject Ho. This means that we cannot show that there is a difference in the two proportions.\n\nChoice 'B' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because the\np\n-values need to be doubled and they were not.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because it says to reject Ho and that should not be done.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the\np\n-values are not doubled and it falsely says to reject Ho.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because it says to reject Ho even though the following part of the sentence is correct.",
