  "question_text": "A researcher was hired to examine a company's production of defective light bulbs. The bulbs were made in two wattages, $60$ and $100$. Fifty $60$-watt bulbs were randomly selected and $70$ $100$-watt bulbs were randomly selected. Eight defective bulbs were found in the $60$-watt type and $11$ defective bulbs were found in the $100$-watt type. While the company wanted to lower the defective rate overall, it was particularly concerned with keeping the defective rate the same for both bulb types.\nWhich procedure below would most effectively give this information?",
