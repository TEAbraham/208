  "question_text": "A survey of $500\\text{ customers}$ for a national chain of coffee houses was conducted to measure whether customers wanted an earlier opening time or were satisfied with the current opening time.<br>The survey found that $181$ of the customers were satisfied with the current hours.<br>Find the $99\\%$ confidence interval for the proportion of the population of customers who were not satisfied with the opening hours, and determine whether we can conclude that the true proportion of customers who are not satisfied is greater than half.",

  "solution": "The number of customers in the sample who are NOT satisfied with the current opening hours is $500-181 = 319$. Therefore, the sample proportion is: $\\frac{319}{500} = 0.638$.\n\nFor a $99\\%$ confidence interval, $Z = 2.576$.\n\nThe calculations for the confidence interval are as follows:\n\n$$\\bar{P} \\pm Z \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\bar{P}(1-P)}{n}} $$\n\n$$= 0.638 \\pm 2.576 \\sqrt{\\dfrac{0.638(0.362)}{500}}$$\n\n$$=0.638 \\pm 2.576(0.02149) $$\n\n$$= 0.638 \\pm 0.05536$$\n\n$$=0.58263 \\text{ or } 0.69336$$\n\nWe can conclude that, yes, the true proportion is greater than half or $50\\%$ since the confidence interval obtained is greater than $0.5$ or $50\\%$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
