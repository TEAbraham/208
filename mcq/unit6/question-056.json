  "solution": "This problem tests the ability to know what type I and II errors are and apply these definitions in the context of a problem.\n\nThis study gave the researchers strong evidence ($t = 3.49$, $p = 0.00341$) that ALL right-handed individuals earn more. However, there is a small chance this conclusion was incorrect and that they made a type I error (rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true).\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; a $p$-value of $0.00341$ makes the researchers correct at the $5\\%$ and $1\\%$ levels.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; a $p$-value of $0.00341$ makes the researchers correct at the $10\\%$ and $5\\%$ levels.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; since the researchers sided with the alternative hypothesis, they cannot be making a type II error.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; $p = 0.00341 < 1\\%$; therefore, the researchers surveyed enough people.",
