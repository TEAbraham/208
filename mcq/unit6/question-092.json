  "question_text": "Suppose the CCO of a local fast food chain is considering two different advertising campaigns: One campaign focuses on low prices, while the other campaign focuses on great service.\nIn the same large city, $15$ randomly selected stores within the chain focused on low prices, and another $15$ randomly selected stores within the chain focused on great service. The CCO hopes to determine if any significant difference exists between the effect of the two advertising campaigns.\nDescribe a Type I error in this context and give consequences of a Type I error.",
