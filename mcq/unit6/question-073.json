  "question_text": "A parent was interested in the proportion of toddlers who go through the \"mine\" stage. This is identified as when a toddler refers to everything as \"mine,\" even when it is not his or hers.<br>The parent randomly sampled $100$ other parents that went into toy store and asked them if their child has experienced the \"mine\" stage. Of these $100$ parents, $89$ parents said their child has gone through or is currently going through the \"mine\" stage.<br>Which of the following represents a $99.6\\%$ confidence interval for the proportion of toddlers that go through the \"mine\" stage?",

  "solution": "The objective of this question is being able to identify the correct mechanical work for a one proportion $z$-interval. The formula for a one-proportion $z$-interval is:\n\n$$\\widehat { p } \\pm z^*\\sqrt { \\dfrac { \\widehat { p } (1-\\widehat { p } ) }{ n } }$$\n\n...where $\\widehat { p } $ represents the sample proportion, $n$ represents the sample size, and $z^*$ represents the critical value.\n\nIn this case, $\\widehat { p } $ is the proportion of toddlers who go through the \"mine\" stage, which in our sample is:\n\n$$\\widehat{p}=\\frac { 89}{ 100 } =0.89, \\quad n = 100$$\n\nThe difficult part in this question is finding the $z^*$ (critical value) for $99.6\\%$ confidence.\n\nYou can find the critical value by using the calculator. When using calculators, a common mistake students will make is to use $99.6\\%$ or $0.996$ which gives a critical value of $2.652$, which is Choice 'B'.\n\nHowever, $0.996$ is incorrect, as a $99.6\\%$ confidence level represents the middle $99.6\\%$ of a normal curve.\n\nWhen we find the $z^*$ in this case, we want the area to the left for $z$, which would make that $99.8\\%$ ($99.6\\% + 0.2\\%$). The $0.2\\%$ comes from the fact when we have the middle $99.6\\%$, that leaves $0.2\\%$ in each tail.\n\nTo find the $z$-score on the TI-84, go to the InvNorm function (2nd Vars #3). Enter the following information:\n\nArea: $0.998$\nMean: $0$\nStandard Deviation: $1$\n\nPress enter and you'll come to $2.878$, which is Choice 'D'.\n\nIf you use table B ($t$ distribution of critical values) note that $99.6\\%$ is not on the table. However $99.5\\%$ and $99.8\\%$ are on the table. The critical values are $2.807$ and $3.091$ respectively.\n\nTherefore, the critical value for $99.6\\%$ must between $2.807$ and $3.091$. The only critical value based on the answer choices above is $2.878$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as the critical value of $2.054$ represents a $96$% confidence interval. Choice 'B' was already discussed. Choice 'C' is incorrect as the critical value of $2.807$ represents a $99.5$% confidence interval. Choice 'E' is incorrect as the critical value of $3.091$ represents a $99.8$% confidence interval.",
