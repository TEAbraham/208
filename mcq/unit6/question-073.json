  "question_text": "A parent was interested in the proportion of toddlers who go through the \"mine\" stage. This is identified as when a toddler refers to everything as \"mine,\" even when it is not his or hers.<br>The parent randomly sampled $100$ other parents that went into toy store and asked them if their child has experienced the \"mine\" stage. Of these $100$ parents, $89$ parents said their child has gone through or is currently going through the \"mine\" stage.<br>Which of the following represents a $99.6\\%$ confidence interval for the proportion of toddlers that go through the \"mine\" stage?",
