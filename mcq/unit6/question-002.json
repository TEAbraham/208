A sample survey contacts an SRS of $100$ recent high school seniors and calculates the proportion $\\hat{p}$ in this sample who graduated high school.\nWhat is the shape of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$?",

  "solution": "Since we are dealing with a sample proportion, $\\hat{p}$, we can use the Large Counts Condition to tell us the shape. The only shape we would be able to prove is approximately normal.\n\nThe sampling distribution of any $\\hat{p}$ is approximately normal if:\n\n$np \\geq 10$\n\nand\n\n$n(1 - p) \\geq 10$\n\nSince our $n=100$ and $p = 0.91$, the inequality $n(1-p)$ does not equal at least $10$ as $100(0.09)$ only equals $9$. Therefore, the shape of the sampling distribution is unknown.\n\nChoice 'E\" is correct.",
