A sample survey contacts an SRS of $100$ recent high school seniors and calculates the proportion $\\hat{p}$ in this sample who graduated high school. What is the shape of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ ?",

  "solution": "Since we are dealing with a sample proportion, ^ p p ^ , we can use the Large Counts Condition to tell us the shape. The only shape we would be able to prove is approximately normal .\n\nThe sampling distribution of any ^ p p ^ is approximately normal if:\n\nn p ≥ 10 n p ≥ 10\n\nand\n\nn ( 1 − p ) ≥ 10 n ( 1 − p ) ≥ 10\n\nSince our n = 100 n = 100 and p = 0.91 p = 0.91 , the inequality n ( 1 − p ) n ( 1 − p ) does not equal at least 10 10 as 100 ( 0.09 ) 100 ( 0.09 ) only equals 9 9 . Therefore, the shape of the sampling distribution is unknown.\n\nChoice 'E\" is correct.",
