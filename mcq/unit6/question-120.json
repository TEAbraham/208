A research company wanted to test this claim and to examine the difference between men and women. $66$ women and $64$ men were randomly selected from those using the drug. Of the women, $28$ said that they lost $10\\%$ of their weight and $38$ of the men said that they did. A researcher wanted to know if more men lost weight.\nIn checking to see if this research met the conditions for a test for the difference of two population proportions, the researcher would verify all of these conditions except:",
