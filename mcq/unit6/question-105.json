  "question_text": "A researcher wants to study the difference between $6$ -year-old boys’ and girls’ belief in Santa Claus. She asks $18$ randomly selected boys and $18$ randomly selected girls. Of those, $9\\text{ boys}$ and $13\\text{ girls}$ said they believe in Santa Claus. The $95\\%$ confidence interval for the difference in the response rates for the boys and girls was $-0.532$ to $0.088$ (boys to girls). What can be inferred from this result?",
