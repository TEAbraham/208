Of those, $9\\text{ boys}$ and $13\\text{ girls}$ said they believe in Santa Claus.<br>The $95\\%$ confidence interval for the difference in the response rates for the boys and girls was $-0.532$ to $0.088$ (boys to girls).<br>What can be inferred from this result?",

  "solution": "A confidence interval can be used as a hypothesis test. In this case, the null hypothesis would state that there is no difference in the two proportions, and the alternative hypothesis would state that there is a difference (two-sided test).\n\nThe null hypothesis of no difference is a possibility, as the value $µD = 0$ is within the calculated confidence interval.\n\nThus, Choice 'D' is the best answer. While the sample proportions show that a greater percentage of the girls believe in Santa Claus than do the boys, the difference is not statistically significant at the $5\\%$ level.",
