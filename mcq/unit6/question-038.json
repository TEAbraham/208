Ava wants to survey a large sample of young girls and ask them to vote for their favorite princess from the following list:<br>Ariel\nBelle\nElsa\nJasmine\nMulan<br>Ava believes that $40\\%$ of young girls would choose Elsa.\nWhat type of significance test should she conduct in order to test this theory?<br>What type of significance test should she conduct in order to test this theory?",

  "solution": "We only have one population of interest: young girls. Our one sample is coming from this population. Since we are interested in conducting inference about a proportion, we would use a $z$-distribution.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. We do not use $t$-distributions for proportions. We would use a $t$-distribution for tests involving a mean or the slope of a least-squares regression line.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because we are not looking for the difference in the proportions of girls who would choose other princesses. We are only interested in the proportion who would choose Elsa.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. We are not looking at the proportions who would choose each princess nor are we looking to see whether those proportions conform to an established distribution. Again, we are only interested in the proportion who would choose Elsa.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. We are not seeking to determine if there is a relationship between two variables in this situation.",
