It decides to randomly sample a bunch of tomatoes and finds that <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.16$</span> of them are rotten.  The manager declared that <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span> times as many should have been sampled, and the same proportion of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.16$</span> were rotten.  How did the width of the confidence interval change, if at all, when the sample size increased by a factor of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span>?</div>",
