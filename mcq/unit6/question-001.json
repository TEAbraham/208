  "solution": "Solution\n\nWhen a random sample is taken, the sample proportion will rarely equal the true population proportion. In this case, the sample proportion produced a $\\hat{p} = 0.52%$ or $52\\%$. But, this value came with a margin of error, so the news station does believes that the value of $52\\%$ is a good starting point, but might not be exactly correct. The news station believes the true population proportion will be:\n\n$52\\% \\pm 3\\%$\n\nTherefore, they believe the true proportion who favor candidate $A$ to be somewhere between $49\\%$ and $55\\%$\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. As stated above, the sample proportion rarely equals the population proportion, and since they stated a margin of error, they don't believe it to be exactly $52\\%$\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. The margin of error needs to be added and subtracted from the estimate to create an interval of possible values.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The margin of error needs to be added and subtracted from the estimate to create an interval of possible values.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This is the interval of values the new station does not believe to be plausible for the proportion of voters who favor Candidate $A$.",
