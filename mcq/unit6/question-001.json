The news station also stated their results come with a margin of error of $3\\%$ . What is believed to be the true proportion of voters who favor Candidate $A$ ?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When a random sample is taken, the sample proportion will rarely equal the true population proportion. In this case, the sample proportion produced a ^ p = 0.52 p ^ = 0.52 or 52 % 52 % . But, this value came with a margin of error, so the news station does believes that the value of 52 % 52 % is a good starting point, but might not be exactly correct. The news station believes the true population proportion will be:\n\n52 % ± 3 % 52 % ± 3 %\n\nTherefore, they believe the true proportion who favor candidate A A to be somewhere between 49 % 49 % and 55 % 55 %\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
