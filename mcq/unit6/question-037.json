The data must come from a random sample.<br>II. $np$ and $n(1-p)$ must both be more than $10$, where $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the probability of success.<br>III. The sample size must be more than $30$.",

  "solution": "Statement I is correct; random sampling is a condition for every inferential procedure in the AP curriculum.\n\nStatement II is correct; itâ€™s important to note, however, that some textbooks use $5$ instead of $10$.\n\nStatement III is incorrect; if the sample is more than $30$, the distribution will be approximately normal, but this condition applies only for sample means, not proportions.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
