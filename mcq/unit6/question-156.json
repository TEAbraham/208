  "question_text": "A sociologist named Dana wanted to know how many girls at age $15$ were interested in pursuing a career in the sciences. Dana’s first step in her study was to randomly choose $3{,}000$ girls across the country and ask them if they were interested in a career in the sciences. $996$ girls replied that they did intend to pursue such a career. Dana created a confidence interval based on her collected data.\nGiven that the upper limit of the confidence interval is $0.352$, find both the margin of error and the confidence level.",
