Danaâ€™s first step in her study was to randomly choose <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$3{,}000$</span> girls across the country and ask them if they were interested in a career in the sciences. <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$996$</span> girls replied that they did intend to pursue such a career. Dana created a confidence interval based on her collected data. Given that the upper limit of the confidence interval is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.352$</span>, find both the margin of error and the confidence level.</div>",
