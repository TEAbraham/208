  "title": "Laptop Battery Life: Interpreting a $p$-Value",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "When Carter bought his new laptop computer, the sales person told him that the average battery life was $5$ hours and that the number of hours of battery life is approximately normally distributed. After using the computer for a few days, Carter began to have his doubts. The next $10$ times that Carter used his computer, he kept track of how long it took for the battery to drain. The sample average was $4.25$.<br>Conducting a one-sided significance test, he found the $p$-value to be $0.038$.<br>What is the best way to interpret this $p$-value in the context of this situation?",
