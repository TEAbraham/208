  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">When Carter bought his new laptop computer, the sales person told him that the average battery life was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> hours and that the number of hours of battery life is approximately normally distributed. After using the computer for a few days, Carter began to have his doubts. The next <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10$</span> times that Carter used his computer, he kept track of how long it took for the battery to drain. The sample average was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4.25$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Conducting a one-sided significance test, he found the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p$</span>-value to be <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.038$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What is the best way to interpret this <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p$</span>-value in the context of this situation?  </div>",
