  "question_text": "When Carter bought his new laptop computer, the sales person told him that the average battery life was 5 5 hours and that the number of hours of battery life is approximately normally distributed. After using the computer for a few days, Carter began to have his doubts. The next 10 10 times that Carter used his computer, he kept track of how long it took for the battery to drain. The sample average was 4.25 4.25 . Conducting a one-sided significance test, he found the p p -value to be 0.038 0.038 . What is the best way to interpret this p p -value in the context of this situation?",
