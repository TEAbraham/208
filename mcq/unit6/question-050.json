  "title": "Laptop Battery Life: Interpreting a $p$-Value",
  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "When Carter bought his new laptop computer, the sales person told him that the average battery life was $5$ hours and that the number of hours of battery life is approximately normally distributed. After using the computer for a few days, Carter began to have his doubts. The next $10$ times that Carter used his computer, he kept track of how long it took for the battery to drain. The sample average was $4.25$.<br>Conducting a one-sided significance test, he found the $p$-value to be $0.038$.<br>What is the best way to interpret this $p$-value in the context of this situation?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "A $p$-value is always calculated based upon the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. In this case, Carter's null hypothesis would have been:\n\n$${ H }_{ 0 }: \\mu = 5$$\n\nBased on sampling variability, we know that a sample mean of $4.25$ hours is possible even if the true mean really is $5$ hours. The $p$-value, however, tells us how likely this is to happen - in this case, only about $3.8\\%$ of the time.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' while a correct statement, is not an interpretation of the $p$-value. Rather, it describes a decision Carter might make about his null hypothesis.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect and makes no sense. In $10$ observations, it is not possible for $3.8\\%$ of the laptops to have a battery life of $4.25$ hours or less. $3.8\\%$ of $10$ would be $0.38$ computers.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect since $3.8\\%$ relates to a probability associated with a sample of $10$ observations. It is not applicable to a single observation, nor to an exact value of $4.25$ hours.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because $3.8\\%$ does not describe a characteristic of the entire population of laptop batteries.",
