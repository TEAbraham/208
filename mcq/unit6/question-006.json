  "question_text": "A soda company is redesigning their label and will hold a focus group to see which label is preferred more by a random group of people. After the focus group, the company finds the proportion of people that like label $A$ to be $0.7$ . If the labels had no effect on each person's choice, what would we assume the probability of selected label $A$ to be?",

  "solution": "When we believe that the design of the label has no effect on the people who chose label A A , that means the people are choosing label A A by chance. Therefore, since there are only two options of labels to choose from, the probability of selecting label A A purely by chance is 1 2 1 2 .\n\nThe probability of selecting label A A purely by chance (if the labels do not have any effect on the person's choice) is 0.5 0.5 .\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
