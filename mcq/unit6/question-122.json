You randomly choose $20\\text{ men}$ and $20\\text{ women}$ from your community and ask them if they have a vegetable garden.<br>Of those asked, $3$ of the men and $5$ of the women have a vegetable garden. You calculate your $z$-test statistic and compute your $p$-value.<br>What assumptions or conditions for comparing two proportions have you violated?",
