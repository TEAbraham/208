  "solution": "One of the assumptions for a one proportion z-interval is that the sample proportion multiplied by the sample size must be greater than $5$ (or $10$), and $1$ minus the sample proportion multiplied by the sample size must be greater than $5$ (or $10$).\n\nThis situation yields $15(0.3) = 4.5$ and $15(0.7) = 10.5$.\n\nSince $4.5$ is less than either standard of $5$ (or $10$), this condition is not met.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
