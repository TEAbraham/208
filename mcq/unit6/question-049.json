  "question_text": "An office manager wonders if her employees put in more hours of work when free bagels are delivered every day. The manager randomly selects $35\\text{ workers}$ to whom bagels will be delivered and compares the number of hours worked by these individuals to another randomly selected group of $35\\text{ workers}$ who do not receive bagels. The computer output is below.
