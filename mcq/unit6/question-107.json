  "question_text": "A spice company was curious as to whether people preferred using salt or pepper. This company sold to many stores on both coasts. The company asked whether sales were higher for salt or pepper in $50$ randomly selected stores on the West Coast and another $50$ on the East Coast. On the West Coast, $30$ stores said that more salt was sold and on the East Coast, $18$ stores said that more salt was sold.\nWhich would be the correct conclusion for a $95\\%$ confidence interval?",
