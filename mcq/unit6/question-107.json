The company asked whether sales were higher for salt or pepper in <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$50$</span> randomly selected stores on the West Coast and another <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$50$</span> on the East Coast.  On the West Coast, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$30$</span> stores said that more salt was sold and on the East Coast, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$18$</span> stores said that more salt was sold.  Which would be the correct conclusion for a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$95\\%$</span> confidence interval?</div>",
