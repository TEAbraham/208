  "question_text": "A study reported that the proportion of college students who experience heart palpitations after drinking an energy drink is $0.18$. The dean of a university believes that the proportion of students at his university who experience heart palpitations after drinking an energy drink is less than $0.18$. The dean randomly sampled students from the university who had just had an energy drink and found that $16\\%$ of them had experienced heart palpitations.<br>All conditions for inference were met, and the $p$-value for the appropriate hypothesis test was $0.30$.\nWhich of the following statements is the best interpretation of the $p$-value?",
