  "question_text": "Cara and all of her high school friends have social media accounts, but she wonders about the proportion of adults who use social media. She hypothesizes that this proportion would be about $65\\%$ and decides that she wants to conduct a study.<br>What is the minimum number of adults she must include in her study for the results of the significance test to be valid?",

  "solution": "The test that Cara would conduct would be a one sample $z$-test for proportions. In order to conduct this test, it must be true that $np \\ge 10$, and $n\\left( 1-p \\right) \\ge 10$ where $n$ is the number of observations and $p$ is the hypothesized proportion. Here, $p = 0.65$ and we need to calculate $n$.\n\nFill in the inequalities and solve. Do not forget to round up to the next whole number.\n\n$$0.65n \\ge 10\\Rightarrow n \\ge 16$$\n\n$$(1-0.65)n \\ge 10\\Rightarrow n \\ge 29$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Just because our hypothesis involves a percentage does not mean that we need to sample $100\\text{ adults}$.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. A hypothesized percentage of $65\\%$ does not translate to the need to sample $65\\text{ adults}$.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. If we were conducting a test for a population mean, then a sample size of $30$ would be considered sufficiently large to apply the Central Limit Theorem. However, the CLT only applies to means â€“ not to proportions.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. It is not sufficient for $np \\ge 10$ to be true. Both this and $n\\left( 1-p \\right) \\ge 10$ must be true.",
