  "solution": "In a normal distribution, a two-sided test indicates half of $0.36$ is in each tail, meaning $0.18$. Please see the picture below.\n\n\n\nThis question tells us that it is one-sided, but not in which direction. Let us assume we are in the left tail. Since we do not know the direction of the one-sided test, we must assume the direction can either be less than or greater than.\n\nFiguring out the less-than component in the left tail is the easier one. Taking half of $0.36$, we get $0.18$. Please see the picture below.\n\n\n\nFiguring out the greater-than component in the left tail is a little bit more challenging.\n\nSince $0.18$ or $18\\%$ is the cutoff in the left tail then we must figure out how much area is to the right of the cutoff. In a normal distribution, the area under the curve is $1$. Therefore $1-0.18=0.82$.\n\n\n\nThe possible $p$-values are $0.18$ and $0.82$.\n\nThis matches Choice 'E'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect as this is only one of two possible answers.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect as this is merely the $p$-value doubled, which does not help determine the possible p-value.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as this only one of the two possible $p$-values.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect as this has one of the choices as the $p$-value doubled or incorrectly subtracted from $1.0$.",
