The CEO of the company wanted to sample its stores to find the proportions of pants on hand which were purchased on a given day. It was found that in a sample of $80$ Cheapos, a proportion of $0.45$ was sold, and in a sample of $80$ Fancies, a proportion of $0.25$ was sold.\nCalculate an approximate interval estimate of the difference of on-hand inventory sold based on a $90\\%$ confidence interval.<br>Calculate an approximate interval estimate of the difference of on-hand inventory sold based on a $90\\%$ confidence interval.",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe formula for a confidence interval for the difference of two proportions is:\n\n(\nˆ\np\n1−\nˆ\np\n2)±z∗\n√\nˆ\np\n1(1−\nˆ\np\n1)\nn1\n+\nˆ\np\n2(1−\nˆ\np\n2)\nn2\n\n...where\nˆ\np\n1\nand\nˆ\np\n2\nare the given proportions, n1\nand n2\nare the given sample sizes, and z∗\nis the critical value for the given confidence level.\n\nIn this problem, we assume all conditions have been verified, we will plug in the values:\n\n(\n0.45\n−\n0.25\n)\n±\n1.645\n√\n0.45\n(\n1\n−\n0.45\n)\n80\n+\n0.25\n(\n1\n−\n0.25\n)\n80\n\nSimplify this to get\n0.20\n±\n0.121\n. Now, because this problem calls for an interval estimate, we will round the lower and upper bounds of the confidence interval as an interval estimate of the differences of the proportions of on-hand sales of the Cheapos and Fancies.\n\n0.20\n±\n0.12\n=\n0.08\nto\n0.32\nor\n8\n%\nto\n32\n%\n.\n\nSo, Choice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because it simply repeats the two given proportions.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because it simply subtracts the two given proportions.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because the critical value is based on a\n99\n%\nconfidence interval.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the critical value is based on a\n95\n%\nconfidence interval.",
