The CEO of the company wanted to sample its stores to find the proportions of pants on hand which were purchased on a given day.  It was found that in a sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$80$</span> Cheapos, a proportion of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.45$</span> was sold, and in a sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$80$</span> Fancies, a proportion of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.25$</span> was sold. Calculate an approximate interval estimate of the difference of on-hand inventory sold based on a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$90\\%$</span> confidence interval.</div>",
