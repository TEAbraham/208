  "question_text": "A group of college students in a psychology class wonders if the order of treatments changes the outcome of a study.<br>To test this, they ask students in a blind taste test which of two colas they prefer, Pepsi or Coke. In this blind taste test, the first $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Pepsi and then Coke. The next $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Coke and then Pepsi.<br>Suppose the test statistic is $z = 1.56$ when comparing the proportion of those who preferred Pepsi when tasted first to the proportion who liked Pepsi when tasted second.<br>On a two-sided test, what is the appropriate conclusion?",
