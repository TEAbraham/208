  "question_text": "A group of college students in a psychology class wonders if the order of treatments changes the outcome of a study.<br>To test this, they ask students in a blind taste test which of two colas they prefer, Pepsi or Coke. In this blind taste test, the first $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Pepsi and then Coke. The next $50\\text{ randomly chosen subjects}$ are given Coke and then Pepsi.<br>Suppose the test statistic is $z = 1.56$ when comparing the proportion of those who preferred Pepsi when tasted first to the proportion who liked Pepsi when tasted second.<br>On a two-sided test, what is the appropriate conclusion?",

  "solution": "Looking up $z = 1.56$ in the standard normal chart gives an upper tail probability of $0 .9406 = 0.0594$. Doubling this $p$-value, since it is a two-sided test, gives a $p$-value of $0.1188$.\n\nSince this is a high p-value compared to even the highest common alpha level of $0.1$, this result fails to give evidence that order makes a difference.\n\nHigh $p$-values can never give strong evidence of no difference; they simply fail to give good evidence of a difference.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.\n\nNote: Even though a high $p$-value exists (at the $5\\%$ and $10\\%$ level), one cannot say this gives evidence of no difference. High $p$-values simply fail to give evidence of change, but they do NOT prove no change happened.\n\nIt might be similar to think of this like a criminal trial. A jury will never prove a defendant innocent. They either will have sufficient evidence to convict the defendant, or fail to have sufficient evidence to convict the defendant.",
