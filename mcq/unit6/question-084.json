  "solution": "We do not want the confidence interval to contain $0.74$, which indicates we want to reject the null hypotheses.\n\nFor each one of the confidence levels, create the significance level that corresponds to the confidence level.\n\nNext, see if you would reject or fail to reject the null hypotheses using the $p$-value and significance level.\n\nFor a $90\\%$ confidence level, the significance level is $10\\%$. $0.062 < 0.10$; therefore we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nFor a $92\\%$ confidence level, the significance level is $8\\%$. $0.062 < 0.08$; therefore we reject the null hypothesis.\n\nFor a $94\\%$ confidence level, the significance level is $6\\%$. $0.062 > 0.06$; therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nFor a $95\\%$ confidence level, the significance level is $5\\%$. $0.062 > 0.05$; therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nFor a $99\\%$ confidence level, the significance level is $1\\%$. $0.062 > 0.01$; therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n\nThe largest confidence level that will not contain $0.062$ is $92\\%$.",
