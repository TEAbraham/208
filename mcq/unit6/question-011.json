  "question_text": "A boss wants to estimate the proportion of her employees who are satisfied with the company's parking policy. She puts all $600$ employees' names into a hat and shakes it before picking $50$ different names out of the hat. Of the $50$, $47$ are satisfied with parking policy and $3$ are not satisfied with it.<br>Which condition for constructing a $1$-sample $z$-interval for proportions has the boss failed to satisfy?",

  "solution": "Choice 'A' is incorrect. The boss put all the names in a hat and picked out $50$. This is a random sample that can be representative of all the employees at the company.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. $47$ is more than $10$, so the normality rule for the number of successes is met.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct. $3$ is not greater than $10$, so the normality for the number of failures is not met.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect, since $50$ is less than $10\\%$ of $600$, this does not fail the condition.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect.",
