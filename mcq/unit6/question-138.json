  "question_text": "One night at twilight, Bella began to wonder if the proportion of teenage males who believe in vampires is lower than the proportion of teenage females who believe in vampires. She decided to investigate and selected a random sample of teenage males and a random sample of teenage females.<br>The samples were independent and people in each sample were asked if they believe in vampires. $14$ of the $150$ teenage males surveyed said “yes”, while $25$ of the $150$ teenage females said “yes”.<br>What is the $p$-value for a test to determine whether the proportion of teenage males who believe in vampires is less than the proportion of teenage females who believe in vampires?",

  "solution": "We want to investigate the difference in the proportion of teenage males and teenage females who believe in vampires. A two-sample $z$-test for proportions is appropriate using the following hypotheses:\n\n${ H }_{ 0 }: { p }_{ \\text{males} } = { p }_{ \\text{females} }$\n${ H }_{ a }: { p }_{ \\text{males} } < { p }_{ \\text{females} }$\n\nBefore completing the test we must check to make sure the conditions have been satisfied.\n\nThe conditions are:\n\nWe must have independent random samples from our populations. We are told that Bella collected independent random samples from both teenage males and teenage females, so this condition is satisfied.\n\nThe populations must be at least $10$ times their respective sample size (or $20$ times the sample size by some sources). While not specifically stated, common sense tells us that the population of teenage males and teenage females is certainly at least $10 \\cdot 150$. We know there are more that $1500$ teenage females and more than $1500$ teenage males!\n\nBoth of our samples must consist of at least $5$ (or $10$ by some sources) successes and at least $5$ (or $10$) failures.\n\nThis condition may also be stated as:\n\n$$n\\hat { { p }_{ 1 } } \\ge 5$$\n\n$$n\\left( 1-\\hat { { p }_{ 1 } } \\right) \\ge 5$$\n\n$$n\\hat { { p }_{ 2 } } \\ge 5$$\n\n$$n\\left( 1-\\hat { { p }_{ 2 } } \\right) \\ge 5$$\n\nIn the sample of males, $14$ said yes (successes) and $136$ said no. Both of these numbers are greater than $5$ (and $10$). Also, in the sample of females, $25$ said yes and $125$ said no. Both of these numbers are greater than $5$ (and $10$). Therefore, we can consider this condition to be satisfied.\n\nSince our conditions are satisfied, we can proceed to calculating our $z$-statistic. The formula is:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac { { p }_{ \\text{males} } - { p }_{ \\text{females} } }{ \\sqrt { \\left( p \\right) \\left( 1 - p \\right) \\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ { n }_{ 1 } } + \\dfrac { 1 }{ { n }_{ 2 } } \\right) } } $$\n\nWe know:\n\n$${ p }_{ \\text{males} } = \\dfrac { 14 }{ 150 } = 0.093$$\n\n$${ p }_{ \\text{females} } = \\dfrac { 25 }{ 150 } = 0.167$$\n\n$$ p = \\dfrac { 14 + 25 }{ 150 + 150 } = 0.13$$\n\nFilling in the formula, we find:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac { 0.093 - { 0.167 } }{ \\sqrt { \\left( 0.13 \\right) \\left( 1 - 0.13 \\right) \\left( \\dfrac { 1 }{ 150 } + \\dfrac { 1 }{ 150 } \\right) } } = -1.91$$\n\nOur alternative hypothesis is in the less than direction, so now we need to find $p(z < -1.91)$. To do this, we can use our TI83/84 graphing calculator's normalcdf function. The syntax is: normalcdf(lower bound, upper bound, mean, standard deviation).\n\nSince we have calculated a $z$-score, we are working from the standard normal distribution whose mean is $0$ and standard deviation is $1$.\n\nTherefore, we would:\n\nEnter and the calculator will return the $p$-value of $p = 0.028$ or about $0.03$.\n\nNote: On a free-response problem it is very important to show all of your work. However, on a multiple choice problem of this nature, you can find the $p$-value directly using your TI83/84 graphing calculator.\n\nHere are the instructions:\n\nThe calculator will return a $p$-value of $p = 0.029$, or about $0.03$.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. There is no logical reason to obtain this $p$-value.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as it simply represents the observed proportion of males who said they believe in vampires.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect and represents the combined proportion of all individuals surveyed who said they believe in vampires.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect and represents the proportion of females who said they believe in vampires.",
