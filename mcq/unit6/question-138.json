She decided to investigate and selected a random sample of teenage males and a random sample of teenage females.\nThe samples were independent and people in each sample were asked if they believe in vampires. $14$ of the $150$ teenage males surveyed said “yes”, while $25$ of the $150$ teenage females said “yes”.\nWhat is the $p$-value for a test to determine whether the proportion of teenage males who believe in vampires is less than the proportion of teenage females who believe in vampires?",
