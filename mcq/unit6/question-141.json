  "question_text": "According to some studies, women are more likely to believe in ghosts than men.  Casper wondered whether women were also more likely to report having seen a ghost than men and decided to do a study. In Casper's random sample of $85$ women, $10$ women reported having seen a ghost at some point in their lives.  In his random sample of $63$ men, only $4$ reported having seen a ghost. Which of the following shows how to calculate the z-statistic for a test of the difference in the proportions of men and women who would report that they have seen a ghost?",
