  "question_text": "A company sold two tablet computers:  the Earth Tablet and the Air Tablet.  The company was looking to investigate whether men or women prefer either tablet. In a random sample of $60$ women, $70\\%$ preferred the Earth Tablet.  A random sample of $60$ men showed that $50\\%$ of them preferred the Earth Tablet.  Based on a $99\\%$ confidence interval, can we be sure that women prefer the Earth Tablet more than the men?  Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" and state why.",
