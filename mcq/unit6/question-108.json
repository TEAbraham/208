  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">A company sold two tablet computers:  the Earth Tablet and the Air Tablet.  The company was looking to investigate whether men or women prefer either tablet. In a random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$60$</span> women, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$70\\%$</span> preferred the Earth Tablet.  A random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$60$</span> men showed that <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$50\\%$</span> of them preferred the Earth Tablet.  Based on a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$99\\%$</span> confidence interval, can we be sure that women prefer the Earth Tablet more than the men?  Answer \"yes\" or \"no\" and state why.</div>",
