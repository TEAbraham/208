  "solution": "Solution\n\nWhen dealing with sampling distributions, the shape of the distribution can vary from one to another. In order to ensure that we can use the normal approximation when dealing with inference problems for the sample proportion, $\\hat{p}$, we must first check the Large Counts Condition,\n\n$np \\geq 10$\n\nand\n\n$n(1-p) \\geq 10$\n\nIf both of these conditions are true, then we can apply the normal approximation to our inference problem.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. When dealing with proportions, we simply need to ensure that the expected number of success and expected number of failures are both at least 10. If we were doing a problem regarding means, then we would have to check the Central Limit Theorem, which the sample size must be larger than $30$.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. To check for independence from one trial to another, you must check the $10\\%$ condition, not the Large Counts Condition.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. In order to use the standard deviation of the sampling distribution for $\\hat{p}$, you must check the $10\\%$ condition, not the Large Counts Condition.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. The mean does not require a condition to be checked. The mean of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}$ simply use the formula $\\mu_\\hat{p} = p$",
