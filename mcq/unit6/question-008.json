  "solution": "When dealing with sampling distributions, the shape of the distribution can vary from one to another. In order to ensure that we can use the normal approximation when dealing with inference problems for the sample proportion, ^ p p ^ , we must first check the Large Counts Condition,\n\nn p ≥ 10 n p ≥ 10\n\nand\n\nn ( 1 − p ) ≥ 10 n ( 1 − p ) ≥ 10\n\nIf both of these conditions are true, then we can apply the normal approximation to our inference problem.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
