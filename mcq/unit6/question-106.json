  "question_text": "In $2014$, the FIFA (Men's) World Cup was held in Brazil. In $2016$, Brazil also hosted the Summer Olympics.<br>Researchers decided to investigate which fans knew where their next big event would be held.<br>In $2014$, researchers asked a random sample of fans attending the FIFA World Cup to identify where the next World Cup would be held. Of those fans surveyed, $61\\%$ correctly said that the next World Cup was scheduled to be held in Russia.<br>In $2016$, researchers also asked a random sample of fans attending the Summer Olympics to identify where the next Summer Olympics would be held. Of those fans surveyed, $56\\%$ correctly identified that the next Summer Olympics were scheduled to be held in Japan.<br>A $95\\%$ confidence interval for the difference in population proportions (World Cup fans - Summer Olympics fans) was constructed and found to be $(-0.04, 0.14)$.<br>Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?",
