In $2016$, Brazil also hosted the Summer Olympics.<br>Researchers decided to investigate which fans knew where their next big event would be held.<br>In $2014$, researchers asked a random sample of fans attending the FIFA World Cup to identify where the next World Cup would be held. Of those fans surveyed, $61\\%$ correctly said that the next World Cup was scheduled to be held in Russia.<br>In $2016$, researchers also asked a random sample of fans attending the Summer Olympics to identify where the next Summer Olympics would be held. Of those fans surveyed, $56\\%$ correctly identified that the next Summer Olympics were scheduled to be held in Japan.<br>A $95\\%$ confidence interval for the difference in population proportions (World Cup fans - Summer Olympics fans) was constructed and found to be $(-0.04, 0.14)$.<br>Which of the following provides the best interpretation of this confidence interval?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "We are interested the difference between two population proportions:\n\nLet ${p}_{WC}$ represent the proportion of attending World Cup fans who would know where the next World Cup is scheduled to be held.\n\nLet ${p}_{SO}$ represent the proportion of attending Summer Olympics fans who would know where the next Summer Olympics is scheduled to be held.\n\nA confidence interval was constructed for the difference in population proportions (World Cup fans - Summer Olympics fans), so the confidence interval describes ${p}_{WC}-{p}_{SO}$.\n\nThe lower bound of the confidence interval is $-0.04$. Therefore, at its lower bound, the confidence interval estimates:\n\n$${p}_{WC}-{p}_{SO}=-0.04$$\n\nAdding ${p}_{SO}$ to both sides of this equation and we get:\n\n$${p}_{WC}={p}_{SO}-0.04$$\n\nWe can interpret this statement to mean that the proportion of World Cup fans is $0.04$ less than the proportion of Summer Olympic fans who would know where their next big event is to be held. Expressed differently, this would mean that the percent of World Cup fans who know where the next event is is $4\\%$ less than the respective percent of Summer Olympics fans.\n\nIn the same way, we can see that the upper bound of the confidence interval estimates that:\n\n$${p}_{WC}-{p}_{SO}=0.14$$\n\nAdding ${p}_{SO}$ to both sides of this equation and we get:\n\n$${p}_{WC}={p}_{SO}+0.14$$\n\nWe can interpret this statement to mean that the proportion of World Cup fans is $0.14$ more than the proportion of Summer Olympic fans who would know where their next big event is to be held. Expressed differently, this would mean that the percent of World Cup fans who know where the next event is is $14\\%$ higher than the respective percent of Summer Olympics fans.\n\nKeeping in mind that the value $95\\%$ expresses our level of confidence in our estimate, the correct choice is Choice 'D'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. While this statement definitely gets all of the given values in, it demonstrates no understanding of the confidence interval. A confidence level does not provide a probability and a proportion cannot be negative.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. While this choice uses slightly different wording, it also presents $95\\%$ as being a probability or the chance that the given statement is true. Again, $95\\%$ is the confidence level, not a probability.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect as it refers to confidence related to the sample of fans who were actually surveyed. There is no need to do inference on the statistic that describes the sample. In fact, we are $100\\%$ confident that the percent of World Cup fans surveyed was $5\\%$ higher than the percent of Summer Olympics fans surveyed who knew where their next big event would be held.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because it has the words \"higher\" and \"lower\" reversed.",
