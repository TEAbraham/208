  "question_text": "A large company sold two different types of deodorant, called Dusty and Nab. It wanted to compare the proportions of customers who were displeased with the performance of these products. A random selection of $100$ Dusty customers were contacted and $25$ were not pleased with the product, while $16$ of the Nab customers were not pleased with their product. A confidence interval was found. If the lower bound of the resulting confidence interval was $-0.072$, and the difference of the proportions was $0.05$, find the confidence level of the confidence interval.<br>Define $\\hat{p}_{1}$ to be the proportion of Dusty customers and $\\hat{p}_{2}$ to be the proportion of Nab customers.",
