  "solution": "When conditions are not met for a confidence interval, one cannot only adjust the calculations in the interval to fix the problem of conditions not being met. Depending on the extent of the violation of conditions, the results cannot be generalized to the population.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
