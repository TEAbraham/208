  "question_text": "A traffic engineer is curious if elderly drivers are more or less likely to get into accidents than teenage drivers. The engineer randomly sampled $100$ teenage drivers and $100$ drivers more than $80$ years old, asking both groups if they have gotten in an accident in the last year. A hypothesis test of $ { p }_{ 1 }= { p }_{ 2 }$ vs. ${ p }_{ 1 } â‰  { p }_{ 2 }$ gives a test statistic $z = 1.13$ . Assuming conditions for inference have been met, what conclusion can be made?",
