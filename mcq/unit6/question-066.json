  "solution": "Choice 'A' is incorrect; assuming the floors are relatively the same size, by surveying one of the $16$ floors, the population should be at least $10$ times the sample.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; the sampling distribution will be approximately normal since np and n ($1$-p) are both more than $10$ (or $5$).\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; expected counts are part of chi-squared conditions, but not for a one-proportion Z-test.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; sample size for proportions does not matter as long as np and n ($1$-p) are both more than $10$ (or $5$).\n\nChoice 'E' is correct; this is not an SRS. It is possible that tenants on the first floor have different feelings about the buildingâ€™s temperature than do tenants in the rest of the building.",
