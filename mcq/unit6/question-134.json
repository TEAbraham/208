This compares to <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$15$</span> randomly chosen subjects ages <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$50$</span>+ where <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> of them said they voted Democrat last election.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">A two-sided test gave a p-value of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.1432$</span> and test statistic of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1.46$</span>.
