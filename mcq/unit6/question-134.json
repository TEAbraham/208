  "question_text": "A political pollster was interested in whether there’s any link between age and political preference. The pollster interviewed $15$ randomly chosen subjects ages $18-24$ and found that $9$ of them said they voted Democrat the last election. This compares to $15$ randomly chosen subjects ages $50$ + where $5$ of them said they voted Democrat last election. A two-sided test gave a p-value of $0.1432$ and test statistic of $1.46$ . The pollster was confused why the sample proportions were so different ( $60\\%$ vs. $33.33\\%$ ) yet failed to show any significant differences at any common alpha levels ( $1\\%, 5\\%$ , or $10\\%$ ). How might you describe this discrepancy to the pollster?",
