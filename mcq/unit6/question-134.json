This compares to $15$ randomly chosen subjects ages $50$+ where $5$ of them said they voted Democrat last election.<br>A two-sided test gave a p-value of $0.1432$ and test statistic of $1.46$. The pollster was confused why the sample proportions were so different ($60\\%$ vs. $33.33\\%$) yet failed to show any significant differences at any common alpha levels ($1\\%, 5\\%$, or $10\\%$).<br>How might you describe this discrepancy to the pollster?",
