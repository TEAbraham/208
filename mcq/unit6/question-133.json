  "solution": "Even a small difference can be considered statistically significant. Itâ€™s likely that only $50\\%-51\\%$ prefer the new logo over the old one. With such a small difference, it may not be worth the time and money to make the new logo.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the problem states that this is a random sample and assumes then that there is no bias.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; a $p$-value of $0.02$ is considered quite low.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the data will be approximately normal since $np$ and $n(1-p)$ are far greater than $10$.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; see Choice 'B' explanation.",
