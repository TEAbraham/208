  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn this problem, we are given two counts for the number of defectives, a single categorical variable. A test of means cannot be used because the sample sizes are different. Therefore, a test for a difference of population proportions must be used.\n\nA t\n-test is used for means while a z\n-test is used for proportions. In this problem we are comparing the proportions of defectives where\n8\n78\n≈0.10\nand\n5\n58\n≈0.09\n. These two proportions need to be tested to see if they are in fact different. Difference is measured through a two-sided test.\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because it states a t\n-test is used instead of a z\n-test.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because it states a t\n-test is used instead of a z\n-test and it says means instead of proportions.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because it states means are to be compared instead of proportions.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because, while a chi-square test for independence can be used for two proportions, a goodness-of-fit test cannot.",
