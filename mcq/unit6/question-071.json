  "question_text": "Last year, $100$ randomly selected dog owners in a certain town were asked, “Do you walk your dog every day?”<br>Suppose this sampling distribution has a mean of $p = 0.38$.<br>Last week, a random sample in the same town found that $45$ out of $100$ subjects walk their dogs every day. The mayor is convinced that people in this town now walk their dogs more.<br>Is there evidence to support the claim stated by the mayor? Use alpha = 10% as your level of statistical significance.",

  "solution": "The standard deviation of the sampling distribution is $0.0485$ using the formula below, with $n = 100$ and $p = 0.38$:\n\n$$\\sqrt{\\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}}$$\n\nFind the $z$-score of getting a sample proportion of $0.45$:\n\n$$\\dfrac{(0.45-0.38)}{0.0485} = 1.44$$\n\nUsing the standard normal table, $P(z > 1.44) = 0.075$.\n\nThis calculation shows that this result would be fairly unlikely to happen if the proportion this year was constant at $38\\%$.\n\nTherefore, one can conclude there is reasonable evidence the mayor is correct.\n\nCompared to $10$%, our probability of $7.5$% was unlikely to happen, since $7.5$% < $10$%. Therefore, there is evidence to support the claim that a higher proportion of people are now walking their dogs.",
