  "question_text": "Last year, $100$ randomly selected dog owners in a certain town were asked, “Do you walk your dog every day?” Suppose this sampling distribution has a mean of $p = 0.38$ . Last week, a random sample in the same town found that $45$ out of $100$ subjects walk their dogs every day. The mayor is convinced that people in this town now walk their dogs more. Is there evidence to support the claim stated by the mayor?  Use alpha = 10% as your level of statistical significance.",

      "text": "No, since the conditions for any calculations involving this problem are not met."

      "letter": "C",
      "text": "No, a result such as this could easily happen due to sampling variability."
