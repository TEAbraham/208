  "question_text": "In an effort to determine what percentage of teenagers text and drive at Griswold High School, a student randomly selected $50$ teenage drivers from Griswold and constructed a $95\\%$ confidence interval. Suppose that the student decides to construct the $95\\%$ confidence interval again, but this time she randomly selects $100$ students.<br>What would happen to the margin of error?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The margin of error represents spread. In general, if the sample size increases, then the spread decreases. Therefore the correct answer is Choice 'B'.\n\nChoice 'D' is a correct statement in that the margin of error will vary from sample to sample, but remember that whenever we increase the sample size, the margin of error will decrease.\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because in order for the margin of error to increase(spread increases) with relation to the sample size, the sample size must decrease.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because in order for the margin of error to stay the same with relation to the sample size, the sample size must remain the same.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because a point estimate refers to a type of center and not the spread. The point estimate won't have any effect on how large or small the margin of error is.",
