  "question_text": "A high school athletic director was interested whether high school males are more likely to compete in sports than high school females are.<br>He randomly sampled $200$ high school males across the country and found that $82$ of them participated in at least one high school sport at some point during the year. This compares to $68$ out of $200$ randomly sampled high school females who participated in at least one sport during the year.<br>Suppose the athletic director wanted to perform a two-proportion $Z$-interval.<br>In addition to needing two independent random samples, another necessary condition is",
