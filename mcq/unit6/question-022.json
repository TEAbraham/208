  "question_text": "You want to design a study for the proportion of adults who agree with this statement: \"Do you think this coin will land on tails when I flip it?\". You will use a $95\\%$ confidence interval, and you want the margin of error to be $.05$ or less.<br>What is the minimum sample size that is required for those conditions?",

  "solution": "The formula for a one-proportion $z$-interval is:\n\n$$\\hat { p } \\pm z^*\\sqrt { \\dfrac { \\hat { p } (1-\\hat { p } ) }{ n } } $$\n\nThe margin of error in this content is after the $\\pm $, meaning that it is:\n\n$$z^*\\sqrt { \\dfrac { \\hat { p } (1-\\hat { p } ) }{ n } }$$\n\nOur general set-up, then, looks like this:\n\n$$z^*\\sqrt { \\dfrac { \\hat { p } (1-\\hat { p } ) }{ n } } \\le M.E.$$\n\nLet us start by substituting in the values we know. Since we are using a $95\\%$ confidence interval, $z^*$ is $1.96$. Since we are not given $\\widehat { p } $, we will make an educated guess as to what we expect it to be.\n\nWe will expect it to be $.5$, since the coin has a $50\\%$ chance of landing on tails. By substituting the values in, our formula now looks like this:\n\n$$1.96\\sqrt { \\dfrac { (0.5)(0.5) }{ n } } \\le .05$$\n\nNow we can solve for this.\n\n1st step: Distribute the radical sign to both the numerator and denominator and simplify:\n\n$$1.96\\frac { \\sqrt { (0.5)(0.5) } }{ \\sqrt { n } } \\le .05$$\n\n$$1.96\\frac { 0.5 }{ \\sqrt { n } } \\le .05$$\n\n$$\\frac { 0.98 }{ \\sqrt { n } } \\le .05$$\n\n2nd step: We don't like working with fractions, so multiply both sides by $\\sqrt { n } $:\n\n$$0.98\\le .05\\sqrt { n } $$\n\n3rd step: Divide both sides by $.05$ and simplify:\n\n$$\\frac { 0.98 }{ .05 } \\le \\frac { .05\\sqrt { n } }{ .05 } $$\n\n$$19.6\\le \\sqrt { n }$$\n\n4th step: Square both sides and solve:\n\n$$({ 19.6) }^{ 2 }\\le ({ \\sqrt { n } })^{ 2 }$$\n\n$$384.16\\le n$$\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect, as $19.6$ was square rooted instead of being squared.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect, as $19.6$ was never squared.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect, as $19.6$ was doubled and not squared.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect, as $770$ is $385$ doubled.",
