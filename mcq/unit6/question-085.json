  "question_text": "For a summer internship with a statistical consulting company, Alison proposed conducting a one-sided (greater than) significance test at the $\\alpha = 0.05$ level. Her supervisor suggested that she try to reduce her probability of making a type I error. If Alison does adjust her significance test so that the possibility of a type I error is reduced, which of the following will also happen? Assume that Alison will still be conducting a one-sided test with the same sample size.\nI. The significance level of the test will be increased.\nII. The probability of making a type II error will be increased.\nIII. The power of the test will be decreased.",
