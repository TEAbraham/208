  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">For a summer internship with a statistical consulting company, Alison proposed conducting a one-sided (greater than) significance test at the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\alpha = 0.05$</span> level.  Her supervisor suggested that she try to reduce her probability of making a type I error.  If Alison does adjust her significance test so that the possibility of a type I error is reduced, which of the following will also happen?  Assume that Alison will still be conducting a one-sided test with the same sample size.</div><blockquote><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>I.</strong> The significance level of the test will be increased.<br><strong>II.</strong> The probability of making a type II error will be increased.<br><strong>III.</strong> The power of the test will be decreased.    </div></blockquote>",
