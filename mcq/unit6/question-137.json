  "question_text": "A researcher wants to determine whether a proclaimed psychic really has any special abilities.<br>Four decks of regular playing cards are shuffled together so that the researcher has $208\\text{ cards}$ in a pile. Half the cards are colored red, and the other half are black. As the researcher looks at each card, the blindfolded psychic calls out the card’s color. Cards are replaced and shuffled after each trial.<br>Assuming conditions are met, at the $5\\%$ level of significance, what is the least number of cards the mind reader must call correctly to show that he is not merely guessing?",

  "solution": "Since the deck is equally split between red and black cards, the psychic has a $0.5$ chance of guessing the card’s color correctly without having any special abilities.\n\nLet $H_0$ be $P = 0.5$ and $H_a$ be $P > 0.5$, where $P$ = proportion of correct guesses at alpha $= 0.05$. The test statistic is calculated as follows:\n\n$$z=\\dfrac{\\hat{p} - p_0}{\\sqrt{\\dfrac{p_0(1-p_0)}{n}}}$$\n\nSince this is a one-sided test, to find an upper tail probability of $5\\%$ (since alpha $= 5\\%$ as stated in the problem), the $Z$-score is $1.645$ using the standard normal table. Therefore:\n\n$z = 1.645$\n$n = 208$ as given by the problem.\n${ p }_{ 0 }= 0.50$, since if there was psychic ability, there would be a 50-50 chance of guessing correct.\n\nUse algebra to solve for $\\hat{p}= 0.557$\n\nThe psychic would need to correctly identify at least $0.557$ of the cards correctly out of the $208$:\n\n$$0.557(208) = 115.86$$\n\nTherefore, he would have to correctly identify $116\\text{ cards}$ for the researcher to believe that he is not guessing.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
