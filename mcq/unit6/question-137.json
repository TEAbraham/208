Cards are replaced and shuffled after each trial. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Assuming conditions are met, at the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5\\%$</span> level of significance, what is the least number of cards the mind reader must call correctly to show that he is not merely guessing?</div>",
