Half the cards are colored red, and the other half are black. As the researcher looks at each card, the blindfolded psychic calls out the cardâ€™s color. Cards are replaced and shuffled after each trial.\nAssuming conditions are met, at the $5\\%$ level of significance, what is the least number of cards the mind reader must call correctly to show that he is not merely guessing?",
