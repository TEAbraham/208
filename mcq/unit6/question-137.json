  "question_text": "A researcher wants to determine whether a proclaimed psychic really has any special abilities. Four decks of regular playing cards are shuffled together so that the researcher has $208\\text{ cards}$ in a pile. Half the cards are colored red, and the other half are black. As the researcher looks at each card, the blindfolded psychic calls out the cardâ€™s color.   Cards are replaced and shuffled after each trial. Assuming conditions are met, at the $5\\%$ level of significance, what is the least number of cards the mind reader must call correctly to show that he is not merely guessing?",
