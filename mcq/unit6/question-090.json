  "question_text": "A study on womenâ€™s weights was recently completed. Fifteen randomly selected high school females from an urban setting were compared to $16$ randomly selected high school women from a rural setting. The results are below: Two-Sample T for Urban Weights vs. Rural Weights N Mean StDev SE Mean Urban Weights 15 126.1 10.5 2.7 Rural Weights 16 128.8 13.2 3.3 $\\text{Difference} = \\mu _{\\text{Urban Weights}} - \\mu_{ \\text{Rural Weights}}$ Estimate for difference: $-2.68$ $95\\%$ CI for difference: ( $-11.45, 6.09$ ) T-test of difference = $0$ (vs. not =): T-value = $-0.63$ , P-value = $0.537$ , DF = $28$ What could be a possible way to reduce the probability of a type I error in this context?",
