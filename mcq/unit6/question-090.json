  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "A lower alpha level demands strong evidence to make any change. Therefore, it is less likely to commit a type I error and make the change when one should not.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; by increasing alpha, the test becomes more sensitive to any change, therefore reducing the odds of a type II error. However, a type I error would be increased since less evidence is required.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; smaller sample sizes increase the probably of type I and II errors.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' are incorrect; two-sample T procedures are based off simple random samples. Furthermore, there is no reason selecting from different areas could reduce variability.",
