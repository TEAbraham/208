  "question_text": "Recently a random survey found that $48$ out of $100\\text{ college freshmen}$ fail to brush their teeth twice a day. This compares higher than the national average of $39\\%$.<br>What would be an appropriate interval at $99\\%$ confidence to estimate the true proportion of college freshmen who do not brush their teeth twice daily?",

  "solution": "Use the formula below to calculate a one-proportion $z$-interval. The sample proportion is $0.48$. Since the problem states this is a $99\\%$ confidence interval, use tables to find the critical value $z^* = 2.576$. The sample size, $n$, is $100$.\n\n$$\\hat{p} \\pm z^{*} \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\hat{p}(1-\\hat{p})}{n}}$$\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
