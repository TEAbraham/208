  "question_text": "According to media reports, a certain political candidate has a higher rate of support among \"young\" voters (those age $30$ and under) than \"older\" voters (those over the age of $30$). A researcher wanted to investigate whether the media reports were true. To gather data, he selected a random sample of $200$ \"young\" voters and a random sample of $200$ \"older\" voters and asked if they supported the political candidate.\nWhich of the following hypotheses could the researcher use to determine if the media claims are true?",
