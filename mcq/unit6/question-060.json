Boris believes that fewer than $15\\%$ of students in his high school would say that they get enough sleep.\nHe conducts a survey by randomly selecting students at school and asking them if they get enough sleep. Completing a one-sided $z$-test for proportions, he calculates his $p$-value to be $0.93$.\nUsing the same data, what would the $p$-value be for a two-sided test?",
