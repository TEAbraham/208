  "question_text": "A traffic engineer wishes to determine whether cell phone use while driving causes subjects to speed.<br>The engineer has organized for subjects’ friends to call while they are driving on a highway and then records their speeds before, during, and after the call.<br>A test is performed on the following hypothesis:<br>$H_0: { P }_{ \\text{phone} }= { P }_{ \\text{no phone} }$\n$H_a: { P }_{ \\text{phone} } ≠ { P }_{ \\text{no phone} }$<br>Define ${ P }_{ \\text{phone} }$ as the proportion who speed while on the phone and ${ P }_{ \\text{no phone} }$ as the proportion who speed while not on the phone.<br>If this test yields a $p$-value of $0.0782$, which of the following conclusions can be made?",
