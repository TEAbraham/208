  "question_text": "A traffic engineer wishes to determine whether cell phone use while driving causes subjects to speed. The engineer has organized for subjects’ friends to call while they are driving on a highway and then records their speeds before, during, and after the call. A test is performed on the following hypothesis: $H_0: { P }_{ \\text{phone} }= { P }_{ \\text{no phone} }$ $H_a: { P }_{  \\text{phone} } ≠ { P }_{  \\text{no phone} }$ Define ${ P }_{ \\text{phone} }$ as the proportion who speed while on the phone and ${ P }_{ \\text{no phone} }$ as the proportion who speed while not on the phone. If this test yields a $p$ -value of $0.0782$ , which of the following conclusions can be made?",
