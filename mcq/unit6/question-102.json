  "question_text": "A traffic engineer wishes to determine whether cell phone use while driving causes subjects to speed.<br>The engineer has organized for subjects’ friends to call while they are driving on a highway and then records their speeds before, during, and after the call.<br>A test is performed on the following hypothesis:<br>$H_0: { P }_{ \\text{phone} }= { P }_{ \\text{no phone} }$\n$H_a: { P }_{ \\text{phone} } ≠ { P }_{ \\text{no phone} }$<br>Define ${ P }_{ \\text{phone} }$ as the proportion who speed while on the phone and ${ P }_{ \\text{no phone} }$ as the proportion who speed while not on the phone.<br>If this test yields a $p$-value of $0.0782$, which of the following conclusions can be made?",

  "solution": "Since the $p$-value is $0.0782$, there is evidence of a difference in proportion of those speeding at the $10\\%$ level. Therefore, a $90\\%$ interval will not contain zero.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'B', 'C', and 'D' are all incorrect; the $p$-value is not less than $5\\%$ or $1\\%$, so one cannot make statements of a $95\\%$ or $99\\%$ confidence interval not containing zero.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; there is not enough information to know this, and there is no relevance in the interval capturing the $p$-value.",
