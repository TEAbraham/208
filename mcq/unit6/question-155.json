  "question_text": "For a senior project, a student wishes to compare the proportions of girls and boys taking AP exams in Calculus. In her school, there are more than $1{,}000$ boys and $1{,}000$ girls. She randomly samples $30$ girls and $20$ boys and asks if they are taking a Calculus AP exam. $16$ boys responded yes and $24$ girls responded yes. While she performs the test and is pleased with her work, she realizes she forgot to check the conditions. Do these results verify the conditions of her making any statistical inference while comparing these two proportions?",
