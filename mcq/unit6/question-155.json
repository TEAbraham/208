In her school, there are more than <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1{,}000$</span> boys and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1{,}000$</span> girls. She randomly samples <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$30$</span> girls and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$20$</span> boys and asks if they are taking a Calculus AP exam.  <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$16$</span> boys responded yes and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$24$</span> girls responded yes.  While she performs the test and is pleased with her work, she realizes she forgot to check the conditions.  Do these results verify the conditions of her making any statistical inference while comparing these two proportions?</div>",
