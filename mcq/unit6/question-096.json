The bulbs were made in two wattages, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$60$</span> and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100$</span>.  Fifty <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$60$</span>-watt bulbs were randomly selected and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$72$</span> <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100$</span>-watt bulbs were randomly selected.  Eight defective bulbs were found in the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$60$</span>-watt type and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$9$</span> defective bulbs were found in the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$100$</span>-watt type.  The researcher decided to create a confidence interval for the difference of the proportion of defective bulbs.  Which of the following is the lower bound of the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$98\\%$</span> confidence interval?</div>",
