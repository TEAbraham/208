  "question_text": "A researcher was hired to examine a company's production of defective light bulbs. The bulbs were made in two wattages, $60$ and $100$. Fifty $60$-watt bulbs were randomly selected and $72$ $100$-watt bulbs were randomly selected. Eight defective bulbs were found in the $60$-watt type and $9$ defective bulbs were found in the $100$-watt type. The researcher decided to create a confidence interval for the difference of the proportion of defective bulbs.\nWhich of the following is the lower bound of the $98\\%$ confidence interval?",
