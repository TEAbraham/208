  "solution": "Choices 'A' and 'B' are incorrect; these attempt to give the definition of P-value, and the latter incorrectly interprets the P-value as well.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct; this accurately gives the definition of test statistic.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the test statistic refers to the number of standard deviations away, not the distance.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; while a large test statistic can be thought of as sufficient evidence, it counts only potentially as evidence to reject the null hypothesis, not the alternative hypothesis.",
