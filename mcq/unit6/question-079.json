  "solution": "Statement I is true; a higher alpha level requires less evidence to make any changes, making the test more sensitive. Since the test is more sensitive now to detect change, the probability of a type II error is lower.\n\nStatement II is true; larger samples are less variable and therefore more predictable, giving stronger evidence (lower p-value).\n\nStatement III is false; while matched pairs experiments in some situations are preferred, other times they are not practical, and matched pairs design does not necessarily reduce the probability of a type II error.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
