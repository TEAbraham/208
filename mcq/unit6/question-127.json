  "difficulty": "Moderate",
  "question_text": "Once upon a time a greater proportion of males played video games than females. Kitana, Jade, Lara and other female gamers wanted to know if this was still true and decided to investigate. Assuming all conditions were satisfied, a $z$ -statistic of $z = 1.08$ was obtained from a test using the following hypotheses: $$H_0: p_{males} = p_{females}$$ $$H_a: p_{males} > p_{females}$$ What should Kitana and her friends conclude based upon the results of her test?",

      "text": "Since the p p -value of the test was less than 0.05 0.05 , we have good evidence to suggest that the proportion of females who play video games is still less than the proportion of males who play video games."

      "letter": "E",
      "text": "Since the z z -statistic is greater than 1 1 , the observed difference in proportions is more than 1 1 standard deviation above a mean difference of 0 0 . Because this happens so rarely, our data proves that the proportion of males who play video games is still greater than the proportion of females who play video games."
