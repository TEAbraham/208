Kitana, Jade, Lara and other female gamers wanted to know if this was still true and decided to investigate. Assuming all conditions were satisfied, a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$z$</span>-statistic of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$z = 1.08$</span> was obtained from a test using the following hypotheses:    </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><div class=\"tex2jax_process\">$$H_0: p_{males} = p_{females}$$</div>    </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><div class=\"tex2jax_process\">$$H_a: p_{males} &gt; p_{females}$$</div>  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What should Kitana and her friends conclude based upon the results of her test?</div>",

Because this happens so rarely, our data proves that the proportion of males who play video games is still greater than the proportion of females who play video games."
