  "question_text": "A students statistics teacher brings a bag of marbles to class. He states that the proportion of red marbles is $0.50$ . To test this proportion, he will have students select random samples of $20$ marbles from the bag. When the student selects their sample of marbles, they get $16$ red marbles for a proportion of $0.80$ . They think this proportion is high, and they don't believe the teacher's proportion of $0.50$ is correct. So, they run a simulation that takes $50$ samples from the teacher's bag of marbles with a known proportion of $0.50$ red marbles. The dot plot of the data is below. What proportion of samples in the student's simulation gave a sample proportion of at least $0.80$ ?",

  "solution": "Since you simulate the bag of marbles 50 50 times, you have 50 50 total observations on the dot plot given. Then looking at the dots, there is only 1 1 sample that produced a sample proportion of at least 0.80 0.80 .\n\nTherefore, we only have 1 50 1 50 samples that produced a sample proportion of 0.80 0.80 , therefore the proportion of samples that is at least 0.80 0.80 is equal to 0.02 0.02 .\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
