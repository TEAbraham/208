  "difficulty": "Easy",
  "question_text": "Giddy Up - Go is a hot new game app that can be downloaded on smartphones.  Researchers wanted to know what proportion of smartphone users have downloaded the app.  They believe that the actual proportion is $0.10$ and have decided to investigate. After surveying a random sample of $225$ smartphone users, the researchers determined that $27$ had downloaded the app. In constructing a confidence interval, which of the following shows how to calculate the standard deviation of the sample proportion?",
