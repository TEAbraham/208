A survey of $50$ random customers last year produced $42$ customers giving this top rating of $5$ diamond to their shoes, but this year a survey of $54$ random customers yielded only $40$ customers giving the same high rating.<br>Calculate a $95\\%$ confidence interval to give an interval estimate for the change in ratings.",
