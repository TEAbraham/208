  "difficulty": "Difficult",
  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Diabetes is a metabolic disease that is characterized by prolonged periods of high blood sugar levels. The disease can be very dangerous, so it is important that those affected by diabetes be diagnosed quickly. Diabetes can be diagnosed if two separate blood sugar readings result in <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$126\\text{ mg/dL}$</span> or higher. However, due to sampling variability and variations in an individual's diet and activity level, two separate readings of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$126\\text{ mg/dL}$</span> or higher are possible even in individuals who do not truly have diabetes.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Suppose a physician notices two consecutive blood sugar readings of exactly <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$126\\text{ mg/dL}$</span> for a particular patient. Since these results are very borderline, she decides to do a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses:</div><blockquote><div class=\"paragraph\"><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$H_0:$</span> The patient has diabetes<br><span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$H_a:$</span> The patient does not have diabetes  </div></blockquote><div class=\"paragraph\">In this situation, what would be the meaning and potential consequences of the physician making a Type I error?    </div>",
