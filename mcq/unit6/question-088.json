  "title": "Making a Type I Error When Diagnosing Diabetes",
  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "question_text": "Diabetes is a metabolic disease that is characterized by prolonged periods of high blood sugar levels. The disease can be very dangerous, so it is important that those affected by diabetes be diagnosed quickly. Diabetes can be diagnosed if two separate blood sugar readings result in $126\\text{ mg/dL}$ or higher. However, due to sampling variability and variations in an individual's diet and activity level, two separate readings of $126\\text{ mg/dL}$ or higher are possible even in individuals who do not truly have diabetes.<br>Suppose a physician notices two consecutive blood sugar readings of exactly $126\\text{ mg/dL}$ for a particular patient. Since these results are very borderline, she decides to do a hypothesis test with the following hypotheses:<br>$H_0:$ The patient has diabetes\n$H_a:$ The patient does not have diabetes<br>In this situation, what would be the meaning and potential consequences of the physician making a Type I error?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "A Type I error occurs when we reject the null hypothesis in error. In other words, we believe the null hypothesis is false when in reality it is true. Here, the null hypothesis is that the patient does have diabetes. The physician thinks this is false and does not treat the disease which results in potentially dangerous consequences.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because it describes the potential consequences of making a Type II error.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. A Type I error is a specific type of error related to our decision about the null hypothesis. It does not relate to errors in measurement.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' are incorrect because they do not describe any type of error. Rather, they describe situations where the correct decision was made.",
