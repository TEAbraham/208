Its slogan promised that people could lose <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10\\%$</span> of their weight in the first month.  A research company wanted to test this and examine the difference between men and women.  <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$64$</span> men and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$66$</span> women were randomly selected from those using the drug.  Of the men, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$38$</span> said they lost <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$10\\%$</span> of their weight and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$28$</span> of the women said they did, too. A researcher wanted to know if more men lost weight. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Write the appropriate hypotheses to test this with <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p_1$</span> representing the proportion of men who lost weight and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$p_2$</span> representing the proportion of women who lost weight.</div>",
