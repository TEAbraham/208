  "question_text": "A new weight-loss drug was on the market. Its slogan promised that people could lose $10\\%$ of their weight in the first month. A research company wanted to test this and examine the difference between men and women. $64$ men and $66$ women were randomly selected from those using the drug. Of the men, $38$ said they lost $10\\%$ of their weight and $28$ of the women said they did, too. A researcher wanted to know if more men lost weight.<br>Write the appropriate hypotheses to test this with $p_1$ representing the proportion of men who lost weight and $p_2$ representing the proportion of women who lost weight.",
