  "question_text": "In order to plan a new advertising campaign, a marketing firm wants to know whether men in a certain area of the country are more likely to purchase a convertible than women in that same area. To gather data, they took a random sample of men and a random sample of women who had recently purchased a new vehicle and then determined both the proportion of men and the proportion of women who had purchased a convertible. A $90\\%$ confidence interval for the difference in the proportion of men vs. women who purchased a convertible was found to be $(-0.021, 0.115)$.<br>Based on this confidence interval should the marketing firm conclude that the proportion of men who purchase a convertible is higher than the proportion of women who purchase a convertible?",

It actually appears that the proportion of women who purchase a convertible is higher than the proportion of men who purchase a convertible."
