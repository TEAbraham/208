  "solution": "Solution\n\nWe can find a conditional relative frequency by using a two-way table. To do this the number of what is being looked for is divided by the row total or column total that is specified as the condition, the group, or the given.\n\nIn this problem, the first question asks for two conditional relative frequencies. This first is for, of the group of men, those preferring popcorn. We first take the number of men preferring popcorn, which is 25\n. Then we divide this number by the total number of men, which is 100\n. Thus the conditional relative frequency for men preferring popcorn is 0.25\n.\n\nThe second is a bit trickier. Of those preferring candy, we are looking at women. So, that number is 25\nand this is divided by 40\nwhich is the total number of people preferring candy. This results in a conditional relative frequency of 0.625\n.\n\nSo, Choice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because the first value is the marginal relative frequency for men preferring popcorn and the second value is the marginal relative frequency for women preferring candy.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because, while the first value is correct, the second value is the conditional relative frequency of the women preferring candy (different denominator!).\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because, while the second value is correct, the first value is the conditional relative frequency of those preferring popcorn, what proportion are men.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the first value is the marginal relative frequency for men preferring popcorn and the second value is the conditional relative frequency of the women preferring candy.",
