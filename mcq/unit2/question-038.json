  "solution": "Solution\n\nA scatterplot is a way of representing the relationship between two quantitative variables. Each pair of points representing the two variables is plotted on a graph and evaluated.\n\nA scatterplot is evaluated on four topics. Its form is examined as to whether it is linear or not. Its direction is looked at to see if it has a positive or negative in slope. If it is linear then the strength of the line is determined. Finally, unusual features are noted which may include outlying points.\n\nIn scatterplots symmetry is not evident. Symmetry is a key feature when examining the distribution of a single variable.\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because form, whether the points form a line or not, is a feature of a scatterplot.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because direction, whether the slope of the line is positive or negative is a feature of a scatterplot.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because unusual features, whether there are any outlying points, is a feature of a scatterplot.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because strength, how close the points are to forming a line, is a feature of a scatterplot.",
