  "question_text": "A company that produces clothes dryers is interested in making changes to its flagship dryer. They want to add a sensor that will alter the time needed to fully dry the clothes. A quality assurance representative collects data on the amount of time it takes a load of clothes to fully dry and records the weight of the clothes in pounds. She creates the following linear regression model that predicts the time needed to fully dry a load of clothes:\n$$\\hat{y} = 32.6 + 1.3x$$\n...where $x = $ the weight of clothes in the dryer in pounds and $y = $ the amount of time needed to fully dry the clothes in minutes.\nWhich of the following statements is false regarding the linear regression model?",

  "solution": "Remember: we're looking for the answer choice that is false.\n\nWhen given a least-square regression line in the form of:\n\n$$\\hat{y} = a + bx$$\n\n...where $a$ represents the $y$-intercept and $b$ represents the slope of the LSRL.\n\nIn this case, our LSRL was:\n\nˆ\ny\n=32.6+1.3x\n\n...so the slope of the LSRL was 1.3. The slope is the amount the predicted y-value changes for every unit increase in x.\n\nTherefore, the slope is not predicted by the weight, it is predicting the time needed to dry the clothes.\n\nSo, Choice 'C' is correct.",
