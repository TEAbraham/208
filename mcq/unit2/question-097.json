  "difficulty": "Difficult",
  "question_text": "A least squares regression analysis of average gas mileage versus speed (mph) produces the following residual plot: Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved. Based on the residual plot, which of the following statement(s) must be TRUE? I. The relationship between speed and average gas mileage is non-linear. II. The average gas mileage decreased as speed increased from $35$ mph to $60$ mph. III. The regression equation would overestimate the average miles per gallon the car gets when the speed is $10$ miles per hour.",
