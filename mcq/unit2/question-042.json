  "solution": "Solution\n\nA scatterplot shows a relationship between two quantitative variables. These are also called a bivariate quantitative data set. One of these variables is represented by an x value and the other by a y value. The x value is called the explanatory variable and the y value is called the response variable. Any set of x and y values are also called coordinates.\n\nResiduals are not directly read from a scatterplot. They require the existence of the linear regression equation and the scatterplot by definition does not include this.\n\nSo, Choice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because sets of coordinates are plotted on a scatterplot.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because the sets of coordinates are also called explanatory and response variables which are plotted on a scatterplot.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because the sets of coordinates consist of x\nand y\nvalues.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because a bivariate quantitative data set is exactly what is represented on a scatterplot.",
