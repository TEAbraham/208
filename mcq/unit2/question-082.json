He wanted to randomly select <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> players and note their weight and the number of home runs they hit.  The student wanted to see if weighing more might predict more home runs being hit.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Of the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> players, the weights ranged from <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$180$</span> to <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$280$</span> pounds.  He obtained a regression equation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\hat{y}=-60+0.4x$</span>. The student wondered if it was reasonable to predict the number of home runs hit by a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$300$</span> pound man and by a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$400$</span> pound man.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">Which answer below seems most reasonable?</div>",
