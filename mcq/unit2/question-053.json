  "solution": "The strongest correlation will have points that are closest to a straight line. If this line is increasing from left to right, the slope is positive and the correlation will approach\n1\n. If this line is decreasing from left to right, the slope is negative and the correlation will approach\n−\n1\n. Correlations of\n1\nand\n−\n1\nare considered to be equally strong.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct; because we can see immediately that this scatterplot has points that form most closely to a single line, it has the strongest correlation and is close to\n−\n1\n. Remember, the strongest correlation will be near\n−\n1\nor near\n1\n.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; this plot has only a moderately weak positive correlation.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; this plot has a strong pattern, but it is NOT linear.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; this plot shows some pattern, but there is NO linear correlation with this model.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; this plot shows a moderately strong correlation, but not nearly as strong as that of Choice 'E'.",
