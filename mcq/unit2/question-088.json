  "question_text": "Which statements is/are true concerning residual plots?<br><br>I. A residual plot is constructed by plotting the explanatory variable values on the $x$-axis against the residuals on the $y$-axis.\nII. A residual plot should have a positive slope if the slope of the least squares regression line is above zero.\nIII. A residual plot shows how the errors in a linear regression model are arranged.",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Statements I and III are correct. These statements describe how to construct a residual plot and what residual plots hope to display.\n\nStatement II is incorrect; residual plots should have a slope of zero or near zero.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
