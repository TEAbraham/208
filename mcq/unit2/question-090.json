  "solution": "The value of the residual is the actual value minus the predicted value. The actual value refers to the corresponding value of\ny\nfor\nx\n, in this case,\n2\n.\n\nThe corresponding value for\nx\n=\n2\nis\ny\n=\n1245\n. Using the regression output, we see that the slope is\n6.436508\nand the\ny\n-intercept is\n1104.643\n. The least squares line is:\n\n1104.643\n+\n6.436508\nx\n\nUsing this equation and plugging in\nx\n=\n2\n, the predicted value of\ny\nis\n1117.516\n.\n\nThe residual is calculated as (actual)-(predicted), or\n1245\nâˆ’\n1117.516\n=\n127.4841\n.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.\n\nNote: one could also estimate the correct answer based off the residual plot.",
