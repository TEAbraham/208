  "solution": "There is a negative non-linear relationship between the number of complaints and monthly sales. The scatterplot shows that as\nx\nmonthly complaints increase,\ny\nmonthly sales decrease. This is a negative relationship.\n\nHowever, the relationship is apparent only after\n15\nor more complaints; therefore, the relationship is non-linear. The slope is negative and non-zero.\n\nThe scatterplot is a graph of bivariate data and cannot show the skew for univariate data. To determine skew, we would need to form frequency distributions for the\nx\nvariables and\ny\nvariables separately.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
