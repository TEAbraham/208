  "question_text": "A researcher wanted to investigate the potential relationship between subjects’ weight and height. After measuring $15\\text{ individuals}$ , the researcher found heights average $68\\text{ inches}$ with a standard deviation of $3.4\\text{ inches}$ . Weights averaged $204\\text{ pounds}$ with a standard deviation of $24.5\\text{ pounds}$ . The correlation coefficient was $r = 0.76$ . What is the equation of the least squares regression line?",
