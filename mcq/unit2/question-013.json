  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Two-way tables always represent categorical data. Categorical data measures data that can fit into specific categories, as opposed to quantitative data that has respondents reply with a number.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct; the variables of gender and political preference are both categorical.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Pain relief, according to the answer, is measured on a scale of 1âˆ’10. Since numbers are used to describe the data, this data is quantitative, not categorical.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. Both weight and height are quantitative variables; therefore a two-way table would not make sense.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Bowling scores are quantitative (some number between 0-300, inclusive); therefore a two-way table would not make sense.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Rainfall measured is quantitative; therefore a two-way table would not make sense.",
