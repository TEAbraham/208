  "question_text": "The housing market in a small town is currently going through a real-estate boom. A realtor is interested in looking at the relationship between the price of a house and the number of days on the market. She collects data from the last $20$ real-estate transactions from her town and created the scatterplot below.\nLoading question supplement...\nWhich of the following is true about the point labeled \"A\" on the scatterplot?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Here's the given graph:\n\nThe labeled point, $A$, is considered a high-leverage and influential point for the scatterplot. A point is considered high-leverage when it has a significantly larger or smaller $x$-value than the other observations have. In this case, the house labeled \"A\" has been on the market much longer than the other homes.\n\nAn influential point is any point that when removed changes the relationship substantially. It can change the y-intercept, slope, or correlation coefficient. In this case point $A$ is increasing the correlation coefficient of the least-squares regression line by keeping the points in a more strongly linear form. When point A is removed, the correlation would thus decrease and the slope of the regression line would remain the same (approximately) because point A is approximately on the same linear path as the other data points.\n\nSo, Choice 'D' is correct.",
