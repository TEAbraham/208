  "solution": "While there certainly may be a relationship between an individual's annual salary and their job title, this relationship would not be revealed by a scatterplot. A scatterplot can be used to display the relationship between two quantitative variables. Since \"job title\" is not a quantitative variable, it would not be possible to create a meaningful scatterplot for this situation.\n\nChoice 'B' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Since both height and number of word puzzles solved in $2$ minutes are quantitative variables, a scatterplot could be produced to investigate this relationship. Furthermore, since taller students may also be older students, the scatterplot may reveal that taller students are able to solve more word puzzles in $2$ minutes.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Since number of individuals in a household and average weekly grocery bill for the household are both quantitative variables, a scatterplot could be produced to investigate this relationship. Most likely, the scatterplot would reveal that the average weekly grocery bill tends to be higher for households that need to feed more individuals.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Since number of A. P. classes and GPA are both quantitative variables, a scatterplot could be produced to investigate this relationship. A scatterplot may (or may not) reveal that students who are enrolled in more A. P. classes tend to have higher GPAs.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since number of days since being paid and amount of money remaining are both quantitative variables, a scatterplot could be produced to investigate this relationship. The scatterplot would likely reveal that as the number of days since being paid increases, the amount of money remaining in an individual's bank account decreases.",
