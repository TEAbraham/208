  "question_text": "As the sport of football grows, teams are becoming increasingly interested in using statistics to better their teams. In a typical football game, a touchdown scored by a team is worth $6$ points. Suppose a team wants to make a graph for the number of touchdowns scored and points scored for their team.<br>Which of the following would be the correlation for this data, assuming there are no extra points scored after each touchdown?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The correlation, $r$, gives the direction and quantifies the strength of the linear association between two quantitative variables. A correlation is considered strong if its value is close to $1$ or $-1$.\n\nIn this case, as the number of touchdowns increases, the number of points will increase by a constant $6$. For example,\n\nSince points are increasingly constantly, the graph would be perfectly linear in a positive direction, as both variables are increasing. Therefore, the correlation would be $r = 1$.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
