  "solution": "A <strong>residual plot</strong> shows the residuals graphed against the explanatory variable. A <strong>residual</strong> shows the difference between the actual response variable and the predicted response variable found from the least-squares regression line. \n\nA residual plot can be used to to investigate the appropriateness of the model used. Apparent randomness in the residual plot is evidence for a linear model. For this problem, the residuals are in a parabolic form, which is not random. Therefore, a linear model is <em>not</em> appropriate for the researcher. \n\n<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is correct. ",
  "distractor_explanations": {
    "A": "<strong>Choice 'A'</strong> is incorrect. Although the researcher did find a least-squares regression line, the model would not accurately depict the situation as the residual plot is parabolic. ",

    "C": "<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is incorrect. When looking at a residual plot, randomness is what indicates a linear model, not clusters. ",
