  "solution": "The table shows the relationship between two categorical variables. To examine the relationship between categorical variables, find the conditional relative frequencies. A conditional relative frequency is a relative frequency for a specific part of the contingency table (e.g., cell frequencies in a row divided by the total for that row).\n\nTo find the conditional relative frequency for unemployed students, we must only look at the 160 students who answered \"unemployed\". When looking at the 160 students who answers \"unemployed\", 80 answered that they lived \"at home\", which is exactly half.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.",
