  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe table shows the relationship between two categorical variables. To examine the relationship between categorical variables, find the conditional relative frequencies. A conditional relative frequency is a relative frequency for a specific part of the contingency table (e.g., cell frequencies in a row divided by the total for that row).\n\nTo find the conditional relative frequency for unemployed students, we must only look at the $160$ students who answered \"unemployed\". When looking at the $160$ students who answers \"unemployed\", $80$ answered that they lived \"at home\", which is exactly half.\n\nChoice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Of the students who answered \"employed\", only $80$ answered \"own\", which is the lowest amount of the three answers.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. A person who answered the survey is more likely to live at home if they are \"unemployed\", not \"employed\".\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Since a total of $80$ students who are unemployed answered live at home and there are a total of $80$ students who answered rent or own, the percentages are the same.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. There are a total of 230 students who answered rent and a total of 500 students who answered in total, it is not quite 50%.",
