  "question_text": "After a baby is born, doctors take routine measurements of three different statistics: height, weight, and head size. A pediatrician wonders if there is a linear association between height and head size. She collects data from the next $20$ babies she examines and finds a correlation of $0.82$.\nInterpret this value in the context of this problem.",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The correlation, $r$, is a measure of the linear association between two quantitative variables. Correlation is unit-free, and always between $−1$ and $1$, inclusive. A value of $r = 0$ indicates that there is no linear association. A value of $r = -1$ or $r = 1$ indicates that there is a perfect linear association.\n\nTo interpret the correlation, one must discuss strength and direction. Since it's a measure of linear association, the form of the graph will always be linear. Therefore, since the correlation is $0.82$, the correlation is strong, while also being positive.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
