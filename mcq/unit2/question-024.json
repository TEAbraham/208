  "solution": "This phenomenon is called Simpson's Paradox.\n\nIf you look at each graduate program, the In-State applicants have a higher admissions rate than the Out of State applicants. So In-State applicants do seem to be favored.\n\nThe medical school has a much lower admissions rate than the other programs. If a huge number of In-State students applied to the medical school, then most of them would not be admitted.\n\nIf Out of State applicants applied mostly to the Business School, then the majority of them would be admitted.",
