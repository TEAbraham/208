Using data from the rest of the class, he came up with the following equation:<br>$$\\text{Final exam score} = 10 + 0.81 \\times (\\text{Unit test score})$$<br>Calculate the residual if Joey got $84\\text{ points}$ on his unit test and $80\\text{ points}$ on the final.",

  "solution": "Residuals are measures of the difference between an expected value and an observed value in a relationship. This problem is calculated as follows:\n\nObserved y=80\nPredicted y=10+(0.81⋅84)=78.04\n\n(observed)−(predicted)=80−78.04=1.96\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
