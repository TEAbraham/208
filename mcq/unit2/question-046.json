  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe explanatory variable is a variable whose values are used to explain or predict corresponding values for the response variable. We can think of the explanatory variable as the independent variable and the response variable as the dependent variable. In a scatter plot, we would see the explanatory variable on the\nx\n-axis and the response variable on the\ny\n-axis.\n\nIn this scenario, it is clear that the number of hours spent practicing will impact the number of goals scored in a season.\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This has the explanatory and response variable reversed.\n\nChoice 'C' and Choice 'D' are incorrect. The number of goals does not impact the hours spent practicing.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. If we are collecting data, there should be a response and an explanatory variable.",
