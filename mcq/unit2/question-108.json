  "question_text": "<div class=\"paragraph\">Members of the Home and School Association at a local high school are in charge of operating the concession stand during home athletic events.  They have been wondering if the number of tickets sold for an event can help to predict the amount of money they will make from selling snacks at the concession stand during the event.  Students in the school's AP Statistics classes have offered to help them out.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">After gathering data about the number of tickets sold and the amount of money made at the concession stand during a random sample of home athletic events, the students used a statistical software program to develop the equation for the least squares regression line (LSRL).  Computer output is displayed below.  </div><div class=\"u-display_flex u-justify-content_center\"><div class=\"u-display_flex u-justify-content_center u-mar-b_2\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" data-prefix=\"fas\" data-icon=\"spinner\" class=\"svg-inline--fa fa-spinner fa-pulse fa-fw fa-2x a-icon content-inherit\" role=\"img\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 512 512\"><path fill=\"currentColor\" d=\"M304 48a48 48 0 1 0 -96 0 48 48 0 1 0 96 0zm0 416a48 48 0 1 0 -96 0 48 48 0 1 0 96 0zM48 304a48 48 0 1 0 0-96 48 48 0 1 0 0 96zm464-48a48 48 0 1 0 -96 0 48 48 0 1 0 96 0zM142.9 437A48 48 0 1 0 75 369.1 48 48 0 1 0 142.9 437zm0-294.2A48 48 0 1 0 75 75a48 48 0 1 0 67.9 67.9zM369.1 437A48 48 0 1 0 437 369.1 48 48 0 1 0 369.1 437z\"></path></svg><label class=\"sr-only\"><progress></progress>Loading question supplement...</label></div></div><div class=\"paragraph\">  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Identify the slope of the LSRL and explain what it means.  </div>",
