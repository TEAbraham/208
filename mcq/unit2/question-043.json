  "solution": "Solution\n\nIf you sketch out these points the problem becomes quite easy. But, using your knowledge of a scatterplot, you know that you are looking to see if the points form a line. These points, in fact, do form a perfect line. Because they form a perfect line then there is no outlier and the association would be strong.\n\nNow, simply by looking at the points, as you order the points by the x values, 0,2,8,12, then look at their y values, 8,7,4,2, you can see that as the x values increase, the y values decrease. This means that since the variables are moving in opposite directions, the association between the variables is negative. (And the slope is âˆ’0.5 if you calculated it!)\n\nSo, Choice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because the points do form a line.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because, since the points form a line, there are no outliers.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because, since the points form a line, the association between the variables would be strong.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because, since the association is negative, it cannot be positive.",
