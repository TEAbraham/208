  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nA quantitative variable takes on numerical values or counts. Therefore, both variables in the answer must have counts. In this case, the number of candies of a certain color in a bag of those candies would be quantitative.\n\nThen the question becomes whether there is a relationship between the two variables. Does one variable somehow rely on the other one? In other words, does one variable affect the other so that the results are not random? Companies tend to actually publish the percentages of candy colors in their bags of a certain candy. It is likely, then, that there is a relationship between the number of orange and the number of brown candies in a bag of Kittles.\n\nSo, Choice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because a person's favorite type of candy is a categorial, not a quantitative variable; it cannot be counted.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because, while both variables are quantitative, it is not likely that the amount of candy a store sells has a relationship with the amount of dog food it sells.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because a person's favorite type of candy is a categorial, not a quantitative variable; it cannot be counted.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because, while both variables are quantitative, it is not likely that the numbers of bags of candy a person buys relates to the number of orange candies that may be in those bags.",
