  "solution": "Choice 'B' is correct. Hours studying and grades on a test are both quantitative variables that could have a possible correlation.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; correlation is calculated only from quantitative variables; while there may be some association between race and music, correlation cannot be calculated.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; r must be between −1\nand 1\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; when explanatory and response variables are switched, the correlation remains the same.",
