  "question_text": "Farmer MacDonald sells his melons at a roadside stand.  He hates carrying along his scale for weighing the melons though and wonders if there is a way to predict the weight ( $\\hat {y}$ ) of a melon by measuring its circumference ( $x$ ). Luckily, his son Junior is taking AP Statistics and knows just what to do!  After weighing (in pounds) and measuring the circumference (in inches) of a random sample of melons, Junior uses a statistical software package to develop the equation of the LSRL.  Computer output is shown below. Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved. Which of the following gives the equation of the LSRL?",
