  "question_text": "Farmer MacDonald sells his melons at a roadside stand. He hates carrying along his scale for weighing the melons though and wonders if there is a way to predict the weight ($\\hat {y}$) of a melon by measuring its circumference ($x$).<br>Luckily, his son Junior is taking AP Statistics and knows just what to do! After weighing (in pounds) and measuring the circumference (in inches) of a random sample of melons, Junior uses a statistical software package to develop the equation of the LSRL. Computer output is shown below.<br>Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved.<br><br>Which of the following gives the equation of the LSRL?",
