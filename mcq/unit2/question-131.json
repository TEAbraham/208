The school counselor decided to survey the students at the high school and ask them if they had a part-time job and if they did, how many hours they worked.

  "solution": "Solution\n\nRemember: the question asks us to find the choice that is not supported by the graph.\n\nThe information given in this problem is summarized in a segmented bar graph. The data on the graph represents two categorical variables. To compare the proportions for all four variables, we examine the stacked columns of the graph.\n\nWhen looking at the\n5\nto\n<\n10\ncategory, sophomores have an approximate proportion of\n0.18\n. But, looking at the senior column, they have an approximate proportion of\n0.20\nthat work\n5\nto\n<\n10\nhours. Therefore, the sophomores do not have the highest proportion who work\n5\nto\n<\n10\nhours.\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Freshman do have the highest proportion of students who do not have a part time job. This is true.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Since over\n50\n%\nof all juniors and seniors work at least\n1\nhour, a majority of juniors and seniors do have a part-time job. This is true.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Only the seniors have a smaller proportion of students without a part-job, the juniors do have the second lowest proportion of students without a part-time job. This is true.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Looking at the\n10\n+\ncategory, the seniors do have the highest proportion of all age groups with about\n25\n%\nof students working\n10\n%\nhours. This is true.",
