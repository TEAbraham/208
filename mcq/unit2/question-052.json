  "solution": "Notice that the question says \"least to greatest,\" not \"weakest to strongest.\" The first graph shows a strong negative linear association (it fits a tight linear pattern).\n\nTherefore, scatterplot\nB\nis the smallest number since it has the strongest negative correlation. This eliminates Choices 'B', 'C', 'E'.\n\nThe next lowest correlation will be the other negative linear association (scatterplot\nD\n). This, leaves Choice 'A' as the correct answer.",
