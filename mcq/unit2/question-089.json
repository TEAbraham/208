  "solution": "By definition, an influential point would markedly change the correlation and least squares regression line.\n\nThis point decreases the slope and decreases the correlation, as the point does not follow the rest of the points.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; while (4.0,4.6)\nis influential, it would decrease the slope, as the back end of the least squares regression line would be pulled up toward it.\n\nChoices 'C' and 'D' are incorrect; this point is not overly influential; it would slightly increase the slope and decrease the correlation, but not markedly.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; therefore, the point\n(\n4.0\n,\n4.6\n)\nqualifies as influential.",
