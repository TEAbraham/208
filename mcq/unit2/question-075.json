  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "We are asked about how an increase in speed would change the fuel economy. In other words, speed is like the independent variable, x\n, and fuel economy is like the dependent variable, y\n. To find how y\nchanges with respect to x\n, we need the slope. By definition, the slope is the change in y\ndivided by the change in x\n. We need to look at our given equation to understand what these numbers are.\n\nLooking at the equation, if we increase speed by 1\n, mileage increases by 0.536\n. So if speed changes by 10\n, fuel economy changes by 5.36\n.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.\n\nCommon Error\n\nA common error is to calculate the mileage at 10 km per hour\n:\n\nMileage (km per liter)=−1.8+0.536×Speed (km per hour)\n\nMileage (km per liter)=−1.8+0.536×10\n\nMileage (km per liter)=−1.8+5.36\n\nMileage (km per liter)=3.56\n\nThis is the mileage at 10 km per hour\n, but it does not represent the change in fuel economy. That is only the term 0.536×Speed (km per hour)\n.",
