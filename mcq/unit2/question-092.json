  "question_text": "A least squares regression line was fitted to the birth rate (per $1000$ women) of women, ages $15-44$, in the United States from $1997$ to $2009$.<br>The equation of the line is $ \\widehat { y } =154.16-.07x$, where $\\widehat { y } $ is the birth rate (per $1000$ women) and $x$ is the year. The birth rate in $2000$ was $14.7$ (per $1000$ women).<br>Which of the following is the residual of the birth rate (per $1000$ women) in the year $2000$?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is incorrect. The year 2000\nwas substituted into the LSRL, but the residual was never calculated. Also, when the year 2000\nis substituted in, the predicted birth rate is 14.16\nand not âˆ’14.16\n.",
