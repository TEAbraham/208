      "text": "Arnold is a fitness trainer at a local gym. Recently, he did a study to investigate the relationship between an individual's body weight and how much they could leg press. He found that the relationship was roughly linear and the correlation was $2.0$. On average, people could leg press twice their body weight."

      "text": "Melissa is a mountaineer who has climbed some of the world's tallest mountains. On her last big climb, she recorded both the altitude (height above sea level) and temperature at several different locations. She found the relationship to be roughly linear with a correlation close to $-1$."

      "text": "Isaac did an experiment to investigate how quickly hot water cools. He started by taking a cup of very hot water and measuring the temperature. He then continued to measure the temperature every two minutes. Upon plotting the relationship between time and temperature, he noticed a very strong, negative, curved relationship, and therefore concluded that the correlation value would be very close to $-1$."
