  "question_text": "A specific breed of Cicada, a type of tree insect, only appears in the Eastern United States every $17$ years. But, the cicadas do not simply show up all at one time. A researcher is working on developing a model to predict the number of cicadas that will show up in his town during the summer. Using historical data, the researcher created the following model:<br>$$ln(\\hat{y}) = 3.4 + 0.87x$$<br>...where $x = $ the number of weeks since the Summer Solstice and $y = $ the number of cicadas in his town (in hundred thousands).<br>Which is the closest to the predicted number of cicadas (in hundred thousands) in his town $2$ weeks after the Summer Solstice?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe regression model used to predict the number of cicadas was a non-linear regression model. Specifically, it was transformed using the natural logarithm function.\n\nTo use the model to predict, we need to get our\nˆ\ny\nby itself. To \"undo\" the natural log, we use its inverse, the natural exponential function, e.\n\nFor example:\n\nln(\nˆ\ny\n)=3.4+0.87x\neln(\nˆ\ny\n)=e3.4+0.87x\nˆ\ny\n=e3.4+0.87x\nˆ\ny\n=e3.4+0.87(2)\nˆ\ny\n=170.71\nˆ\ny\n=171\n\nTherefore, the closest number of cicadas in the researchers town is 171\n(hundred thousands)\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A\" is incorrect. To use the regression model, we first must get\n^\ny\nby itself, then plug in\n2\nweeks. We cannot simply plug\n2\ninto the given regression model.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Weeks is the explanatory variable, not the response variable. Therefore,\n2\nmust be plugged into\nx\n, not\ny\n.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Remember the inverse of the natural log is the natural exponential log. We cannot solve a natural log problem by using base\n10\n.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Remember the inverse of the natural log is the natural exponential log. We cannot solve a natural log problem by using base\n2\n.",
