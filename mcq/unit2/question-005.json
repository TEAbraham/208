  "solution": "Solution\n\nRelationships between quantitative variables can be shown a variety of ways. Associations between these variables may be evident by looking at scatterplots or by using the points on a scatterplot to calculate a linear regression equation. In addition, distributions can be compared to show relationships between variables. For example, histograms and boxplots can be shown side-by-side for a comparison of distributions.\n\nIn this problem two-way tables are the exception. These are used to establish relationships between categorical variables.\n\nSo, Choice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because a scatterplot can be used to show a relationship between two quantitative variables.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because comparing two distributions using histograms can be used to show a relationship between two quantitative variables.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because comparing two distributions using boxplots can be used to show a relationship between two quantitative variables.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because linear regression can be used to show a relationship between two quantitative variables.",
