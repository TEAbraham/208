  "difficulty": "Hard",
  "question_text": "A common tradition in the Midwest is hunting for Morel mushrooms during springtime. These mushrooms only grow during certain weather conditions and in certain locations. A mushroom hunter wonders about the production from a location in his local forest. He gathers historical data regarding the amount of rainfall (in inches) and the amount of mushrooms (in ounces) from a mushroom tracking website and finds a least-squares regression line of:<br>$$\\hat{y} = 18.2 + 0.85(x)$$<br>...where $x =$ the amount of rain in inches and $y =$ the amount of mushrooms in ounces. In the most recent year, the forest received $3$ inches of rain and produced $20.2$ ounces of mushrooms.<br>Which of the following is true about the mushroom production?",

      "text": "The actual amount of mushrooms for the most recent year was less than predicted."
    }
  ],
  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When looking at the difference between the actual response variable, $y$, and the predicted response variable, $\\hat{y}$, we want to examine the residual of the data. The formula to find this is\n$$\\text{residual} = y - \\hat{y}$$\n\nThe given least-squares regression line was\n$$\\hat{y} = 18.2 + 0.85(x)$$\nPlugging in our rainfall amount, $x = 3$,\n$$\\hat{y} = 18.2 + 0.85(3)$$\n$$\\hat{y} = 18.2 + 2.55$$\n$$\\hat{y} = 20.75$$\n\nTherefore, to find the residual,\n$$\\text{residual} = y - \\hat{y}$$\n$$\\text{residual} = 20.2 - 20.75$$\n$$\\text{residual} = -0.55$$\n\nTherefore, the actual amount is less than the predicted amount from the least-squares regression line.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
