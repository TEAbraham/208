  "solution": "Solution\n\nThere are a great many ways that relationships between variables can be explored. While numbers can be used in different ways, the types of variables involved must be considered. For example, two quantitative variables can be examined by making a scatterplot. In this example, however, both variables are categorical.\n\nCategorical variables, of course, can still be counted in different ways. More explanation here will be given in the explanation of distractors. The question here asks which one of the answers is an exception; that is, the method of examination will not work to find a relationship. In this problem, the description of the histogram is incorrect. The $x$-axis cannot contain categories, it must contain equal-sized numerical intervals.\n\nSo, Choice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because two-way tables can be used to compare two categorical variables.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because a chi-square test for independence is based upon a two-way table of two categorical variables.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because such a test could be done as long as counts are being compared.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because such a test could be done as long as proportions are being compared.",
