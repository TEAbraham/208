  "question_text": "Greg has been offered a job as a sales representatives for Medi-Machines. In this job, he would be selling medical devices to doctors' offices and hospitals. Before accepting the job however, he wants to estimate how much he will be able to earn on average each week.<br>Greg has been offered a base salary of $\\$200$ per week plus a commission of $\\$175$ for each device sold. Therefore, his weekly earnings $E$ could be described by the linear equation given below.<br>$$E=200+175D$$<br>Medi-Machine's sales records indicate that the mean number of devices sold weekly by all of the company's representatives is ${\\mu}_{D}=8.76$ and Greg feels confident that he would be able to average at least this much.\nBased upon this information, what is the mean amount that Greg could expect to earn weekly if he decides to take the job?<br>Based upon this information, what is the mean amount that Greg could expect to earn weekly if he decides to take the job?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "To solve this problem very simply, just substitute the value of ${\\mu}_{D}$ into the equation for $E$.\n\nE=200+175(8.76)=1733\n\nTo be a little more formal, consider the following:\n\nThe amount of money Greg would be able to earn weekly, E, is a random variable that depends upon how many devices he sells weekly, D (which is also a random variable).\n\nWe know μD=8.76 and need to find μE.\n\nE\nis a linear transformation of D\nand is described by the equation given. Therefore, by substitution:\nμE=μ200+175D\n\nThe value of μD\nis affected by both the multiplication by 175\nand the addition of 200\n. Step by step we find:\nμ175D=175∙(μD)\n\nμ175D=175∙(8.76)=1533\n\nThen:\nμ200+175D=200+μ175D\n\nμ200+175D=200+1533=1733\n\nChoice 'D' is the correct choice.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. The mean number of devices sold weekly is 8.76\nbut this is not a dollar amount.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect and represents the base salary only.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. You would arrive at this value if you rounded the mean number of devices sold weekly down to 8\n. It is not appropriate to round a mean to a whole number.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. You would arrive at this value if you rounded the mean number of devices sold weekly up to\n9\n. Again, rounding a mean to a whole number is not appropriate.",
