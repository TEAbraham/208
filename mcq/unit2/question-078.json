Greg has been offered a base salary of $ 200 $ 200 per week plus a commission of $ 175 $ 175 for each device sold.  Therefore, his weekly earnings E E could be described by the linear equation given below. E = 200 + 175 D E = 200 + 175 D Medi-Machine's sales records indicate that the mean number of devices sold weekly by all of the company's representatives is μ D = 8.76 μ D = 8.76 and Greg feels confident that he would be able to average at least this much.
