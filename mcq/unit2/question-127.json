  "question_text": "Which of the statements is/are true regarding transforming a model involving an explanatory and response relationship?<br><br>I. One should consider transforming the data if the residual plot of residuals on $X$ fails to show a pattern.<br>II. One should consider transforming the data if the scatterplot of $X$ against $Y$ shows a curved pattern.<br>III. One should consider transforming the data if the correlation coefficient, $r$, is $-0.30$.",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Statement I is incorrect; if the original model is the best model available, the residual plot should show no pattern.\n\nStatement II is correct; if the original plot shows a curved pattern, it is likely the form is exponential.\n\nStatement III is incorrect; some models will simply have a weak correlation, regardless of any transformations. This could indicate either a weak correlation or that a transformation is needed. A plot of the residuals will give a better indication of whether or not a transformation is needed.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
