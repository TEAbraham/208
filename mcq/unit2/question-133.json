  "question_text": "A golfer is preparing for a tournament on an ocean course. The wind is notorious for causing golfers to struggle. The golfer wonders if there is an association between the speed of the wind (in miles per hour) and the number of birdies (making the golf ball in the hole one stroke under the expected number of strokes) a golfer makes.<br>He examines historical data for hole $13$ on the course and records the wind speed for the day and the number of birdies made by golfers. A graph is shown below.<br>The golfer believes there to be a positive association between the wind speed and number of birdies made. Is he correct?",

      "letter": "D",
      "text": "No, the scatterplot shows a negative association between wind speed and number of birdies made."
    },
    {
      "letter": "E",
      "text": "There is no association as past outcomes do not affect future outcomes."

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The scatterplot is a graph of bivariate quantitative data, which is two data points collected on one individual. In this case, the graph shows the number of birdies golfers made against the wind speed on the day of play.\n\nExamining the scatterplot, it shows that the number of birdies drastically decreased as the wind speed increases. This would imply a negative association, meaning as the values of one variable increases, the values of the other variable tend to decrease.\n\nSince the graph is showing a negative association, and not a positive association, the golfer's belief is incorrect.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
