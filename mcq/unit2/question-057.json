  "question_text": "A small neighborhood coffee shop sells both hot coffee drinks and iced coffee drinks. The owners of the coffee shop decided to investigate the relationship between the outside high temperature on a given day and the number of hot coffee drinks that they are able to sell that day. The computer output is shown below.<br><br>Determine the correlation coefficient for this relationship.",

  "solution": "The computer output gives us the\nr\n2\nvalue as\nr\n2\n=\n0.5041\n. We are looking for the correlation coefficient, or simply the correlation value\nr\nwhich measures both the direction (positive or negative) and the strength of the relationship between two quantitative variables. Begin by solving the following equation for\nr\n:\n\nr\n2\n=\n0.5041\n\nTake the square root of both sides of the equation. Don't forget to take both the positive and negative square root of\n0.5041\n:\n\n√\nr\n2\n=\n±\n√\n0.5041\n\nr\n=\n±\n0.71\n\nWe must now choose whether the appropriate value for correlation is positive or negative. Since the sign (positive or negative) of the value for\nr\nis the same as the sign of the slope of the LSRL, we need to determine the slope.\n\nThe explanatory variable\nx\nin this situation is the outside high temperature and the coefficient of this variable is the slope of the LSRL. In the computer output, notice that the column labeled \"Coef\" and the row labeled \"Variable\" intersect at the value\n−\n8.27\n. This is the slope of the LSRL.\n\nSince the slope of the LSRL is negative, the relationship between the number of orders for hot coffee and the outside high temperature is negative. As the temperature increases, we would expect fewer orders for hot coffee. Also, if we know that the relationship is negative, then the correlation value\nr\nmust also be negative as well. Therefore, the value we are looking for is\nr\n=\n−\n0.71\n.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. This value represents the slope for the LSRL. While the slope and the correlation values will both have the same sign (positive or negative), the value of the slope is unlikely to also be the value for the correlation. Also, correlation is always a value between\n−\n1\nand\n1\ninclusive. Therefore, this value is not a valid value for correlation.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. This value is close to what the computer output reports for the standard deviation related to the slope of the LSRL but the decimal has been moved over. Perhaps this represents an attempt to make the value something between\n−\n1\nand\n1\n, but the correlation cannot be determined by looking in the column labeled \"StdDev\".\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This value is the value for\nr\n2\nas reported in the computer output. This value is the coefficient of determination and represents the proportion of variance in the number of orders of hot coffee that can be explained by the linear relationship with high outside temperature. It is not the correlation coefficient.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. This value is the positive answer for\nr\nthat you will arrive at if you forget to take both the positive and negative square root when solving the equation or if you forget to make sure that the sign of the correlation matches the sign of the slope for the LSRL.",
