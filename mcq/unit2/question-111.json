  "solution": "To find the least squares regression line, you must identify the dependent variable as the $y$-variable. In this case, the $y$-variable is Wingspan, so we can eliminate Choices 'C', 'D' and 'E'.\n\nWhen looking at the table to find the regression equation, the only thing to pay attention to is the coefficient column. A coefficient is a number in front of the variable, so the constant coefficient ($-2.273$) represents the $y$-intercept and $1.084$ represents the slope (the number that goes in front of the height).\n\nTherefore, the answer is Choice 'A'.",
