  "question_text": "A student was interested in the ratio of boys to girls in classes at her school. She randomly selected $10\\text{ classes}$ and found the least squares regression line of this data to be $\\hat { g } = 23.2-1.7b$, where $b$ is the number of boys in the classroom, and $g$ is the number of girls in the classroom.<br>Which of the following best describes the meaning of the slope of the least squares regression line?",
