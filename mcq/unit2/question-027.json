  "solution": "Solution\n\nWe can find a conditional relative frequency by using a two-way table. To do this the number of what is being looked for is divided by the row total or column total that is specified as the condition, the group, or the given.\n\nIn this problem the question asks for the conditional relative frequency for driving an SUV in the group of women. Thus, we first take the number of SUV's driven by women, which is 50. Then we divide this number by the total number of women, which is 100. Thus the conditional relative frequency for women driving SUV's is 0.50.\n\nSo, Choice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because this number resulted from dividing by the total of 200,\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because this number is the conditional relative frequency for men driving SUVs.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because this number is the average of the men and women conditional relative frequencies for driving SUVs.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because this number is the conditional relative frequency for being a woman among the SUV drivers.",
