A random sample of $100$ individuals in each of three age categories was asked to classify themselves as being \"Liberal\" or \"Conservative\".  The results are displayed in the side-by-side bar graph below. Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved. Based on this display, what is the conditional distribution of Liberals by age category?",
