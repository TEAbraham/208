A random sample of $100$ individuals in each of three age categories was asked to classify themselves as being \"Liberal\" or \"Conservative\". The results are displayed in the side-by-side bar graph below.\nCreated for Albert.io. Copyright 2016. All rights reserved.\nBased on this display, what is the conditional distribution of Liberals by age category?",
