  "solution": "A simple linear regression model is an equation,\n$$\\hat{y} = a + bx$$\nthat uses an explanatory variable, $x$, to predict the response variable, $y$.\n\nThis problem is asking for the predicted increase of the response variable, not the predicted response variable. To solve this problem, we can do two different methods:\n\nMethod $1$: Use $x = 5$ and $x = 0$ and find the difference:\n$$\\hat{y} = 10 + 1.2(5) = 16$$\n$$\\hat{y} = 10 + 1.2(0) = 10$$\nTherefore,\n$$16 - 10 = 6$$\n\nMethod $2$: Simply use the slope of the equation. Since the slope of the equation, $\\hat{y} = a + bx$, is represented by $b$, the slope in our equation is $1.2$. The slope is the increase of the predicted response variable for every increase of $1$ unit of the explanatory variable.\n\nTherefore,\n$$1.2(5) = 6$$\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
