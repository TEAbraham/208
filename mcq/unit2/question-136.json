  "solution": "A simple linear regression model is an equation,\nˆ\ny\n=a+bx\nthat uses an explanatory variable, x\n, to predict the response variable, y\n.\n\nThis problem is asking for the predicted increase of the response variable, not the predicted response variable. To solve this problem, we can do two different methods:\n\nMethod 1\n: Use x=5\nand x=0\nand find the difference:\nˆ\ny\n=10+1.2(5)=16\nˆ\ny\n=10+1.2(0)=10\nTherefore,\n16−10=6\n\nMethod 2\n: Simply use the slope of the equation. Since the slope of the equation,\nˆ\ny\n=a+bx\n, is represented by b\n, the slope in our equation is 1.2\n. The slope is the increase of the predicted response variable for every increase of 1\nunit of the explanatory variable.\n\nTherefore,\n1.2(5)=6\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
