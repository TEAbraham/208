  "solution": "When interpreting a scatterplot the main topics are strength (strong, weak, moderate), direction (positive or negative), and form (linear, exponential, etc.).\n\nIt also can be useful to mention any clusters or unusual features in the scatterplot.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'E' are incorrect; these all are ways to interpret single variable data. However, a scatterplot deals with bivariate data (two variables).",
