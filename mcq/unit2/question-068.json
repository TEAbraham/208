  "solution": "The data appears to be much more spread out at higher speeds, making predictions less accurate.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the correlation appears strong.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; there is more than enough data for this scatterplot.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; the data does NOT level off; if anything, there is a slight increase in the scatterplot at higher speeds.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; this might be a problem if one wanted to use this model for speeds of faster than $40$ miles per hour, but otherwise, it is suitable for speeds up to $40$ miles per hour.",
