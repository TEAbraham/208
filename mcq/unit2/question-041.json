  "solution": "A scatterplot is used to plot bivariate (two variable) data. The data must be quantitative. A scatterplot allows one to plot an explanatory variable against a second response variable.\n\nAn example of a scatterplot is below.\n\n\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Single data categorical data (race, gender, political party preference) is best graphed in a pie chart or bar graph.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. Single data quantitative data (income, age, bowling score) is best graphed with a stemplot, histogram, boxplot, or dotplot.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Use a two way table to display two categorical variables (such as ethnicity versus political preference).\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. Since a scatterplot is based off an x\nand y\n-axis (2 axes), the data graphed must represent 2 variables, not 3.",
