  "question_text": "A local real estate agent is interested in the relationship between the cost of a house ($y$) in dollars and its area ($x$) in square feet. She randomly selects $50$ houses around town and computes the least squares regression line: $\\hat { y } =136.89x+14578.91$.<br>Which of the following is the correct interpretation of the slope of the least squares regression line?",
