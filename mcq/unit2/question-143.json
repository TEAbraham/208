  "solution": "An outlier in regression is a point that does not follow the general trend shown in the rest of the data and have a large residual when the least-squares regression line (LSRL) is found.\n\nIn this example, the general trend is the more you study, the higher your test score. Students who studied a good amount of time for the test, typically did well, while students who did not study much, typically did poorly on the exam. Only one point in the graph does not follow this trend, Point B.\n\nChoice 'B' is correct.",
