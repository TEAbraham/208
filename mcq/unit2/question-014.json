  "solution": "Two-way tables, by definition, deal with categorical values.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; two-way tables deal with categorical variables, not quantitative.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; one *could *make a two-way table from two independent samples if they were categorical, but not if the samples are quantitative.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; linear regression T\nprocedures would be used for bivariate data with an explanatory/response relationship.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; a single sample could be made into a two-way table, but only if two categorical variables are involved.",
