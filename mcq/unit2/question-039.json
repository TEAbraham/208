  "solution": "Scatterplots are used to determine if a correlation exists between two quantitative variables.\n\nRemember quantitative variables are measured with numbers, such as one's weight, number of siblings, age, or ACT score.\n\nOn the other hand, categorical variables are measured with words and cannot be displayed on a scatterplot. Examples of categorical variables include favorite color, types of trees on your property, race, or favorite genre of music.\n\nIn this problem, income and height are two quantitative variables, so a scatterplot could be used to determine if any relationship exists.\n\nA scatterplot can never be used to determine relationships between one or two categorical variables, rendering the other answer choices incorrect.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
