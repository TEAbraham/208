One can take the log log of the x x and y y -values to transform an exponential relationship into a linear relationship. II. If the original data is of exponential form, one can increase the correlation coefficient, r r , by transforming the data to linear form. III. As long as there is a strong correlation ( | r | > 0.7 | r | > 0.7 ), the data is most likely linear.",
