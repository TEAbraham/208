One can take the $\\log$ of the $x$ and $y$-values to transform an exponential relationship into a linear relationship.\nII. If the original data is of exponential form, one can increase the correlation coefficient, $r$, by transforming the data to linear form.\nIII. As long as there is a strong correlation ($|r| > 0.7$), the data is most likely linear.",
