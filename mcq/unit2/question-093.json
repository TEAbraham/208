  "question_text": "Two variables, $x$ and $y$ , were taken on $10$ subjects and two separate regression models were fit to the data. Regression I yielded the following equation and residual plot: predicted log  y = ax + b ...where $a$ and $b$ are constants. Regression II yielded the following equation and residual plot: predicted log  y = d + log cx ...where $c$ and $d$ are constants. Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved. Which of the following conclusions is correct?",
