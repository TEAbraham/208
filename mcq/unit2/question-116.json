  "question_text": "A student is interested in how life expectancy (in years) has changed in the U.S. since 1930. The student gathers data between the years 1930 to 2010. He finds the least squares regression line to be:<br>$$\\widehat {\\text{life expectancy} } = 0.228\\text{ year }-378.15$$<br>He also finds the correlation to be $0.981$.<br>Which of the following is the correct interpretation for the slope in this case?",
