He believes that the rent asked for an apartment can be predicted based on the square footage.<br>A random sample of $25\\text{ apartments}$ was collected and a least square regression line was obtained with a slope = $1.0632$, a $y$-intercept of $83.527$, and $R^2$ value of $0.8165$.<br>Determine the predicted rental price for a $1{,}200\\text{ ft}^2$ apartment.",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The least squares line will always have two components; a slope and $y$-intercept. The general form for the least squares regression line is:\n\n$$y = a + bx$$\n\n...where $b$ represents the slope, and $a$ represents the $y$-intercept.\n\n$a = 83.527$ and $b = 1.0632$ based off the problem, giving us the following equation:\n\ny=83.527+1.0632x\n\n...where y represents predicted rental price and x represents square footage.\n\nSince x=1200, then rent is predicted by the following formula:\n\ny=83.527+1.0632(1200)=1359.37\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
