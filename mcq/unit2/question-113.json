The least squares regression line must pass through the averages of the dependent and independent variables.\nII. The least squares regression line is constructed in such a way as to minimize the distance between the observed points and the $x$-axis.\nIII. The least squares regression line is not resistant to extreme observations.",

  "solution": "Statements I and III are correct; these are properties of the least squares regression line.\n\nStatement II is incorrect; the least squares regression line is constructed as a way to minimize the squares formed by the vertical distance between the points and the least squares regression line.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
