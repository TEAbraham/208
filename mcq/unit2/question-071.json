Combining the female and male data results in a stronger correlation than inspecting their correlations separately.<br>II. When inspecting males and females separately, females have a weaker correlation.<br>III. Since gender is categorical, this image represents a misuse of scatterplots.",

  "solution": "Statement I is correct; males seem to have a moderate correlation and females have a weak positive correlation. However, when inspected together, there appears a fairly strong positive correlation.\n\nStatement II is correct; the correlation for females is fairly weak to nonexistent, but the correlation for males is moderate.\n\nStatement III is incorrect; it is a good statistical process to break quantitative data into categorical variables in a scatterplot. This plot shows the user much more detailed information than if males and females were not plotted separately.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
