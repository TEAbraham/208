  "question_text": "Junior year of high school is traditionally a time of high stress for students as they begin making decisions about college. A reporter for the Maintown High School newspaper is planning to write an article about the topic of \"Junior Year Stress\" and wonders if this stress is experienced equally by both boys and girls.<br>To gather data for her article, the reporter surveyed a random sample of juniors and asked them to identify how often they felt stressed about school. Results, broken down by gender, are shown in the table below.<br>Based upon the results shown, should the reporter claim that there is a difference in the levels of stress experienced by boys and girls during their junior year?<br>Based upon the results shown, should the reporter claim that there is a difference in the levels of stress experienced by boys and girls during their junior year?",

      "text": "No. Although there appears to be a difference in the other two categories, the number of boys and girls claiming they are \"Rarely Stressed\" is almost equal. Since this category is close to equal, we cannot claim an overall difference in the stress levels of boys and girls."

    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "No. The conditional distributions of stress levels are very similar for both boys and girls. Since the stress levels occur in about the same proportions for both genders, we cannot claim that there is a difference."

      "letter": "C",

      "letter": "D",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'B' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The conditional distribution of stress levels breaks down each level of stress into a proportion (or percentage) of the total by gender. Doing this can help us to compare how the stress levels for boys compares to that for girls.\n\nThere were a total of $19+28+3$ or $50\\text{ boys}$ surveyed and a total of $27+39+4$ or $70\\text{ girls}$ surveyed. The conditional distributions of stress level by gender are shown below.\n\nWe can see from this table that the proportion of boys experiencing a certain level of stress is about the same as the proportion of girls experiencing that same level of stress. In other words, they experience stress about equally and we cannot claim a difference.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. We cannot claim that the distributions of stress levels are the same based only upon the results from one category. Furthermore, the results shown indicate counts of students. We cannot compare counts in a situation where the sample size for girls is not the same as the sample size for boys.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. It is true that the number of girls reporting that they are stressed at least \"sometimes\" is higher than the number of boys reporting the same level of stress. However, the number of girls surveyed was also higher than the number of boys surveyed so this is not unexpected.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The marginal distributions are simply the totals. These were not shown in the two-way table but were calculated above. The marginal distribution for boys is $50$ and the marginal distribution for girls is $70$. This only tells us that there were more girls surveyed than boys.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. We are not looking for a difference by category and could not establish one by simply looking at the counts within those categories.",
