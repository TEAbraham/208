  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is incorrect; the opposite is true. r must have no units attached to it.",
  "solution": "Choice 'B' is correct; a correlation near âˆ’1 suggests a strong negative correlation, and a correlation near 1 suggests a strong positive correlation.\n\nChoice 'C'is incorrect; correlation can only describe linear relationships.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; when switching the x and y variables, correlation is exactly 1.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; changing any units to data does not change the correlation.",
