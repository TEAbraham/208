  "correct_answer": "The correct answer is <strong>Choice 'E'</strong>. Changing the units of variables does not change the correlation coefficient “r,” because we get rid of all our units when we standardize (get z-scores).    The standardization allows us to compare correlations between data sets where variables are measured in different units or when variables are different.  ",
