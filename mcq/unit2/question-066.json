  "difficulty": "Moderate",
  "question_text": "The correlation between distance (in kilometers) and airfare (in dollars) is $0.8$ . If we were to change the distance to be measured to miles (all the values in the distance will therefore be divided by $1.61$ ), what effect will this have on the correlation?",

    {
      "letter": "A",
      "text": "The correlation will become 0.5 0.5 ."
    },
    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "The correlation will decrease by 0.5 0.5 , making the new correlation 0.3 0.3 ."
    },
    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "The correlation will become 1.3 1.3 ."
    },
    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "Since only the distance measurements have changed, the correlation will decrease significantly."
    },
    {
      "letter": "E",
      "text": "Because changing units does not affect the correlation, the correlation will remain the same."
    }
  ],
  "correct_answer": "The correct answer is Choice 'E' . Changing the units of variables does not change the correlation coefficient “r,” because we get rid of all our units when we standardize (get z-scores).    The standardization allows us to compare correlations between data sets where variables are measured in different units or when variables are different.",
