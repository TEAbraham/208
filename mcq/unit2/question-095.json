  "solution": "Residual plots should show no pattern, and this residual plot clearly does.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; residual plots will have zero correlation even if there is some pattern.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; while the data does not appear exactly linear since the data still remains close to the LSRL, there will be a strong correlation. However, a transformed model will have an even stronger correlation.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; while the residual plot does show a linear model might not be best, it is not because the residuals are overly large. In fact, it appears that the residuals have fairly low values.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; a residual of\n0\nis what is predicted; therefore, this model overpredicts, then underpredicts, and then overpredicts once again.",
