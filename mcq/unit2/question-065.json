The resulting correlation was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.98$</span>. Which of the following statements are true?</div><blockquote><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>I.</strong> If you leg press more than someone else, then you will have a higher vertical jump than him or her.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>II.</strong> If you leg press less than someone else, you will have a lower vertical jump than him or her.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><strong>III.</strong> There is a very strong positive linear association between leg press ability and vertical jump.    </div></blockquote>",
