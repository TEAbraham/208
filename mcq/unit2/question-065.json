  "question_text": "A study was done that measured the association between people's vertical jump ability (how high they can jump from a stationary position) and how much they can leg press. The resulting correlation was $0.98$. Which of the statements are true?<br>I. If you leg press more than someone else, then you will have a higher vertical jump than him or her.<br>II. If you leg press less than someone else, you will have a lower vertical jump than him or her.<br>III. There is a very strong positive linear association between leg press ability and vertical jump.",
