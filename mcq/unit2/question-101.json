  "question_text": "A popular travel website rates hotels using a star system.  The worst hotels may receive 0 0 stars or 1 1 star and the most luxurious hotels are rated a maximum of 5 5 stars.  Nicky needs to book a hotel room in a large metropolitan area in order to attend a friend's wedding. She decided to see if there was a relationship between the number of stars in a hotel's rating and the lowest price for staying at a hotel the night of her friend's wedding.  From a random sample of data gathered on the travel website, she developed the following LSRL. ˆ y = 27.54 + 50.27 x ^ y = 27.54 + 50.27 x ...where x x is the hotel's star rating and ˆ y ^ y is the predicted lowest price (in dollars) for booking a room at the hotel. If Nicky wants to stay at a 4 4 star hotel, what is the lowest price she would expect to pay for her room?",
