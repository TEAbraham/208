  "question_text": "A popular travel website rates hotels using a star system. The worst hotels may receive $0$ stars or $1$ star and the most luxurious hotels are rated a maximum of $5$ stars. Nicky needs to book a hotel room in a large metropolitan area in order to attend a friend's wedding.<br>She decided to see if there was a relationship between the number of stars in a hotel's rating and the lowest price for staying at a hotel the night of her friend's wedding. From a random sample of data gathered on the travel website, she developed the following LSRL.<br>$$\\hat { y } =27.54+50.27x$$<br>...where $x$ is the hotel's star rating and $\\hat{y}$ is the predicted lowest price (in dollars) for booking a room at the hotel.<br>If Nicky wants to stay at a $4$ star hotel, what is the lowest price she would expect to pay for her room?",
