The worst hotels may receive <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0$</span> stars or <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1$</span> star and the most luxurious hotels are rated a maximum of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> stars.  Nicky needs to book a hotel room in a large metropolitan area in order to attend a friend's wedding.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">She decided to see if there was a relationship between the number of stars in a hotel's rating and the lowest price for staying at a hotel the night of her friend's wedding.  From a random sample of data gathered on the travel website, she developed the following LSRL.    </div><div class=\"paragraph\"><div class=\"tex2jax_process\">$$\\hat { y } =27.54+50.27x$$</div>  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">...where <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$x$</span> is the hotel's star rating and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\hat{y}$</span> is the predicted lowest price (in dollars) for booking a room at the hotel.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">If Nicky wants to stay at a <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span> star hotel, what is the lowest price she would expect to pay for her room?</div>",
