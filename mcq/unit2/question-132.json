  "question_text": "A researcher is interested in seeing if there is a connection between the number of hours of television a child watched per week while they were young and the score on a reading comprehension exam. The researchers believe that the more hours of television watched, the lower the score on the comprehension exam.<br>Which of the following graphs could represent the researchers' beliefs?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe data regarding amount of time watching television when younger and reading comprehension make up a bivariate quantitative data set. A bivariate quantitative data set consists of observations of two different quantitative variables made on individuals in a sample or population.\n\nThe graphical representation of bivariate quantitative data is called a scatterplot. As noted in the prompt, the researchers believed the more television hours watched as a child, the lower the reading comprehension scores would be. Therefore, we are looking for a graph that has a negative direction. The only graph that has a negative direction is Graph E.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. The graph shows a parabolic relationship between the two variables, not a negative relationship.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. The graph also shows a parabolic relationship between the two variables, not a negative relationship.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. The graph shows neither a positive or negative relationship between the two variables.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. The graph shows a positive relationship between the two variables, not a negative relationship.",
