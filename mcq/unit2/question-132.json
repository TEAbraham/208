  "correct_answer": "<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "The data regarding amount of time watching television when younger and reading comprehension make up a <strong>bivariate quantitative data</strong> set. A bivariate quantitative data set consists of observations of two different quantitative variables made on individuals in a sample or population.\n\nThe graphical representation of bivariate quantitative data is called a <strong>scatterplot</strong>. As noted in the prompt, the researchers believed the more television hours watched as a child, the lower the reading comprehension scores would be. Therefore, we are looking for a graph that has a negative direction. The only graph that has a negative direction is <strong>Graph E</strong>.\n\n<strong>Choice 'E'</strong> is correct. ",
  "distractor_explanations": {
    "A": "<strong>Choice 'A'</strong> is incorrect. The graph shows a parabolic relationship between the two variables, not a negative relationship. ",
    "B": "<strong>Choice 'B'</strong> is incorrect. The graph also shows a parabolic relationship between the two variables, not a negative relationship. ",
    "C": "<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is incorrect. The graph shows neither a positive or negative relationship between the two variables. ",
    "D": "<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is incorrect. The graph shows a positive relationship between the two variables, not a negative relationship."
