  "solution": "The plot shows a positive correlation, but it appears only moderate. You may input the data into your calculator to get a correlation value of\nr\n=\n0.64\n. However, you should be able to eye-ball the correlation to be somewhere in the\nr\n=\n0.5\nto\nr\n=\n0.7\nrange.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; removing point (\n4\n,\n9\n) does not markedly change the correlation or LSRL.\n\nChoice 'B'is incorrect; there is clearly a positive, not negative, correlation.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; the correlation is moderate, not strong.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect; this point is not far enough outside the overall pattern to be considered a regression outlier.",
