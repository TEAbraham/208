  "title": "Too Much Brass?",
  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "A manufacturer of specialty cabinet hardware produces over $5{,}000$ decorative brass corner braces every day. The Quality Control Manager suspects that too much brass is being used to produce the braces. Based on measurements from the past quarter, the weight follows a strongly skew right distribution with $\\mu=30$ grams and $\\sigma=4$ grams.<br>What is the probability that in a simple random sample of $100$ units, the mean weight is more than $31$ grams?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe sampling distribution of the sample mean weight of\n100\nbraces has mean\nμ\n¯\nx\n=\nμ\n=\n30\n  grams. It is explicitly given that the company produces thousands of units per day, so the\n10\n%\ncondition is met:\n10\n(\n100\n)\n=\n1000\n<\n5000\n; thus the sampling distribution of the sample mean weight of\n100\nbraces has standard deviation\nσ\n¯\nx\n=\nσ\n√\n100\n=\n4\n√\n100\n=\n0.4\n.\n\nSince the sample size\nn\n=\n100\n≥\n30\n, the shape of the sampling distribution of the sample mean weight is approximately normal. We want to find\nP\n(\n¯\nx\n>\n31\n)\n.\n\nCalculations\n\nP\n(\n¯\nx\n>\n31\n)\n\nP\n(\n¯\nx\n−\nμ\n¯\nx\nσ\n√\nn\n>\n(\n31\n)\n−\n(\n30\n)\n0.4\n)\n\nP\n(\nz\n>\n2.5\n)\n=\n1\n−\nP\n(\nz\n<\n2.5\n)\n≈\n0.0062\nor\n0.62\n%\n\nUsing TI-84: normalcdf(31,1E99,30,0.4)\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect.\n\nThe error obtaining\n40.13\n%\nlies in using the standard deviation\nσ\n=\n4\nfor the sampling distribution. This is incorrect because the sample size is\nn\n=\n100\n, NOT\nn\n=\n1\n. It is important to remember that as sample size increases, variation and standard deviation decrease.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect.\n\nThe error obtaining\n72.25\n%\nlies in taking the square root of the standard deviation\n√\nσ\n; Be sure to distinguish the difference between standard deviation and variation of a population, and standard deviation of a sampling distribution. In a sampling distribution, the standard deviation is always affected by the sample size. Generally speaking, the sampling distribution of sample means from simple random samples of size\nn\n, drawn from a population with standard deviation\nσ\n, will have spread\nσ\n√\nn\n.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect.\n\nThis probability represents the chance that the average weight is less than\n31\ngrams. The upper and lower standardized bounds were mistakenly interchanged. Be sure that you know how to read a table(\nz\n-distribution tables are left hand probabilities) and/or the syntax of your calculator’s commands.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect.\n\nSince the company produces thousands of braces each day, the sample size\nn\n=\n100\nsatisfies the\n10\n%\nCondition, thus\nσ\n¯\nx\n=\nσ\n√\nn\n. Furthermore, since the sample size is greater than\n30\n, the Large Counts Condition is satisfied, and the distribution of\n¯\nx\nis approximately Normal\nN\n(\n30\n,\n4\n√\n100\n)\n. This is sufficient to compute probabilities using standard normal calculations.",
