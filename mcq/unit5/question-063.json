  "question_text": "A community organization wishes to know the proportion of subjects who feel financially comfortable in a certain town.<br>Based on last year’s census, $64\\%$ of the town residents felt financially comfortable. In this year’s survey, $56$ out of $115$ randomly chosen subjects expressed feeling financially comfortable. The organization wishes to determine if the residents’ opinion of financial comfort has changed from last year.<br>If the town has a population of $500$, why would it be incorrect to use a normal probability calculation on proportions?",

  "solution": "To use the standard deviation formula shown below, the population must be at least 10 times the sample. In this problem, the population is 500 and the sample size is n=115.\n\n√\np(1−p)\nn\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; the problem said it was an SRS.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; the sampling distribution is approximately normal in this situation since n(p)\nand n(1−p)\nare both greater than 10\n, where n=115\nand p=0.64\n.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; it is clear the sample sizes are large enough since the np\nand n(1−p)\nconditions are met.",
