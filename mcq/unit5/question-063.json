In this year’s survey, $56$ out of $115$ randomly chosen subjects expressed feeling financially comfortable. The organization wishes to determine if the residents’ opinion of financial comfort has changed from last year.<br>If the town has a population of $500$, why would it be incorrect to use a normal probability calculation on proportions?",
