  "question_text": "Mr. Skonte and Mr. Thurban volunteer as umpires for their local youth baseball programs. Mr. Skonte calls strikes correctly $95.1\\%$ of the time ($\\hat{p}_S=0.951$), while Mr. Thurban calls strikes correctly $96.9\\%$ of the time ($\\hat{p}_T=0.969$). Because they love to game so much, and are good at what they do, Mr. Skonte and Mr. Thurban plan to apply to be professional umpires.\nA scout decides to watch each of them umpire a random selection of pitches and compute the difference in the proportion of correctly called strikes.\n$100$ pitches for each umpire\n$200$ pitches for each umpire\n$300$ pitches for each umpire\nUnder which of the above circumstances would the sampling distribution of the difference of correctly called strikes be approximately Normal?",
