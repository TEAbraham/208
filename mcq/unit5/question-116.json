  "question_text": "Mr. Skonte and Mr. Thurban volunteer as umpires for their local youth baseball programs. Mr. Skonte calls strikes correctly $95.1\\%$ of the time ($\\hat{p}_S=0.951$), while Mr. Thurban calls strikes correctly $96.9\\%$ of the time ($\\hat{p}_T=0.969$). Because they love to game so much and are good at what they do, Mr. Skonte and Mr. Thurban plan to apply to be professional umpires.<br>A scout decides to watch each of them umpire a random selection of pitches and compute the difference in the proportion of correctly called strikes. The scout wants to determine whether there is convincing statistical evidence that the two umpires are equally accurate at calling strikes.<br>Under which of the above circumstances would the sampling distribution of the difference of correctly called strikes be approximately Normal?",

  "solution": "Solution\n\nIn order for the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions to be approximately Normal, we can calculate the combined proportion and verify check that the following four values are greater than or equal to $10$:\n\n$$n_1 \\hat{p}_c \\geq 10$$\n$$n_2 \\hat{p}_c \\geq 10$$\n$$n_1(1- \\hat{p}_c )\\geq 10$$\n$$n_2 (1-\\hat{p}_c )\\geq 10$$\n\n...where $\\hat{p}_c$ is equal to:\n\n$$\\hat{p}_c=\\frac{n_1\\hat{p}_1+n_2\\hat{p}_2}{n_1+n_2}$$\n\nLet's check when $n_1,n_2=300$ pitches for each umpire. Then, $\\hat{p}_c$ is:\n\n$$\\hat{p}_c=\\frac{300 \\cdot 0.951+300 \\cdot 0.969}{600}$$\n$$\\hat{p}_c=0.96$$\n\nNow, we can check the four conditions above (two of which are the same since $n_1=n_2$):\n\n$$300 (0.96)=288 \\geq 10$$\n$$300 (1-0.96)=12 \\geq 10$$\n\nTherefore, the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}_1-\\hat{p}_2$ is approximately Normal when there are $300$ pitches.\n\nChoice 'C' is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. If we check the conditions for $100$ pitches, we get:\n\n100(0.96)=96≥10\n100(1−0.96)=4≱10\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. If we check the conditions for 200 pitches, we get:\n\n200(0.96)=192≥10\n200(1−0.96)=8≱10\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. We've verified that 200 pitches are not enough to assume an approximately Normal distribution.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect. If we do not use a combined p value for the two populations, we will arrive at this answer. If we check Mr. Thurban's\nˆ\np\nT value at 300 pitches, we will get:\n\n300(0.969)=290.7≥10\n300(1−0.969)=9.3≠10",
