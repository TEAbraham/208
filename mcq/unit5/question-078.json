  "question_text": "In a large metropolitan area, the proportion of high school seniors who drive to school at least $3\\text{ days a week}$ is $0.45$. A random sample of $25\\text{ students}$ is chosen.<br>How would you calculate the probability that at least $13$ of these students drive to school at least $3\\text{ days a week}$?",

  "solution": "One can use the normal approximation to the binomial when $np \\ge 10$ and $n(1-p) \\ge 10$. In this problem:\n\n$$np = (25)(0.45) = 11.25$$\n\n...and:\n\nn(1−p)=(25)(0.55)=13.75\n\n...so the conditions for using the normal approximation are met.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect; there are many lines from the sample space that would be required in order to calculate the entire probability, not just the one line listed here.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect; it states the wrong standard deviation; it should be\n√\n(25)(0.45)(0.55)\n≈2.49.\n\nAdditionally, the calculator requires that you input the values of n\nand p\n, not μ\nand σ\n.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect; a large sample size in and of itself does not automatically allow the use of the normal approximation.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect; binomial formula would have to be used 13 times, for each of the values of interest for X\n(13≤X≤25\n), to calculate the desired probability.",
