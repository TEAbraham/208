  "solution": "Solution\n\nStandard Normal calculations give the percent of outcomes expected through chance variation in random sampling. Thus the probability computed via Normal Probability Calculations indicates that 0.7%\nof samples of size 90\nfrom unfertilized bamboo, and 100\nfrom fertilized bamboo will show a difference in mean growth of 1.5 cm\nor less.\n\nThe sampling distribution of difference in sample mean growth of bamboo is approximately Normal with mean:\n\nμ\nˉ\nx\nf−\nˉ\nx\no=μf−μo=12.9−11=1.9 cm\n$\n\n...and standard deviation:\n\nσ\n¯\nx\nf\n−\n¯\nx\no\n=\n√\nσ\n2\nf\nn\nf\n+\nσ\n2\no\nn\no\n=\n√\n0.9\n2\n100\n+\n1.3\n2\n90\n≈\n0.1639\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect.\n\nThis incorrect interpretation assumes a mean difference of zero in interpretation but uses a mean difference of\n1.9\nin the calculation.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect.\n\nThis incorrect interpretation assigns an arbitrary and casual term \"works\" to the probability. In fact, the\n0.7\n%\nrepresents the percent of outcomes expected through chance variation in random sampling that will show a mean difference of\n1.5\n cm\nor less.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect.\n\nThis incorrect interpretation assigns the complement of\n0.7\n%\nto the chance that fertilizer will out-perform non-fertilizer. In fact, the\n0.7\n%\nrepresents the percent of outcomes expected through chance variation in random sampling that will show a mean difference of\n1.5\n cm\nor less.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect.\n\nThis incorrect interpretation attributes the\n0.7\n%\nto the difference in the growth of fertilized vs. unfertilized bamboo. In fact, the\n0.7\n%\nrepresents the percent of outcomes expected through chance variation in random sampling that will show a mean difference of\n1.5\n cm\nor less.",
