The average daily growth of fertilized bamboo in peek growing season is $\\mu_f=12.9 \\text{ cm}$ with standard deviation $\\sigma_f=0.9 \\text{ cm}$.<br>A random sample of $90$ unfertilized and $100$ fertilized bamboo plants are tracked during peak growing season and the difference in their sample's average growth is analyzed.<br>The difference in sample mean growth is found to be $\\bar{x}_f-\\bar{x}_o=1.5 \\text{ cm}$.<br>Interpret the likelihood of a difference in sample mean as little as $1.5 \\text{ cm}$.<br>",
