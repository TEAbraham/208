  "question_text": "Snack-sized bags of fruit-flavored candy are manufactured so that the weights are nearly normally distributed with a mean of $64\\text{ grams}$ and a standard deviation of $1.5\\text{ grams}$ .  It is reasonable to assume that the bags are packaged randomly for shipment to stores. Waldo purchased $12$ snack-sized bags of this fruit-flavored candy and found that the average weight of these bags was $63\\text{ grams}$ . Does Waldo have reason to believe he was cheated? Calculate the probability of obtaining a sample mean less than or equal to $63\\text{ grams}$ .",
