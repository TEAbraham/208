  "question_text": "Which of the statements is/are true concerning sampling distributions?<br><br>I. Larger sample sizes have a sampling distribution with more variability.\nII. Larger sample sizes have a sampling distribution that becomes closer to a normal in shape, but only if the parent population is normal.\nIII. Poor sampling methods could result in a sampling distribution centered away from the true population mean.",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'C' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Statement I is incorrect; larger samples have a sampling distribution with less variability.\nStatement II is incorrect; larger samples have a sampling distribution closer to normal no matter what the shape of the parent population is; this is a consequence of the central limit theorem.\n\nStatement III is correct; poor sampling methods will result in bias where the mean of the sampling distribution may not be the same as the population mean.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
