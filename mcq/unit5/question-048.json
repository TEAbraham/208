  "question_text": "A national Italian restaurant has created a healthy option to one of its most popular dishes. The original dish’s portion size has a mean $\\mu$ of $1{,}500\\text{ calories}$ with a standard deviation of $50\\text{ calories}$ , and the healthy alternative’s portion size has a mean $\\mu$ of $950\\text{ calories}$ with standard deviation of $25\\text{ calories}$ . The resulting normal distribution of the calorie savings by choosing the healthy option over the original dish has a mean $\\mu$ of $550\\text{ calories}$ saved and standard deviation $\\sigma$ of $55.9\\text{ calories}$ . John and Mary go to the restaurant, and both order the healthy option. What is the probability that their average calorie savings is equal to or greater than $600\\text{ calories}$ when John and Mary both opt for the healthier alternative?",
