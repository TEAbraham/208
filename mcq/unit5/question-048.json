  "question_text": "A national Italian restaurant has created a healthy option to one of its most popular dishes.<br>The original dish’s portion size has a mean $\\mu$ of $1{,}500\\text{ calories}$ with a standard deviation of $50\\text{ calories}$, and the healthy alternative’s portion size has a mean $\\mu$ of $950\\text{ calories}$ with standard deviation of $25\\text{ calories}$.<br>The resulting normal distribution of the calorie savings by choosing the healthy option over the original dish has a mean $\\mu$ of $550\\text{ calories}$ saved and standard deviation $\\sigma$ of $55.9\\text{ calories}$. John and Mary go to the restaurant, and both order the healthy option.<br>What is the probability that their average calorie savings is equal to or greater than $600\\text{ calories}$ when John and Mary both opt for the healthier alternative?",

  "solution": "The sampling distribution of calorie savings when we are concerned with the average for $n = 2$ becomes $\\mu = 550$, which is unchanged.\n\n$$\\sigma(\\text{new}) = \\dfrac{\\sigma(\\text{old})}{\\sqrt{2}} $$\n\n$$=\\dfrac{55.9}{1.414} $$\n\n$$= 39.53$$\n\nNow find the probability that $\\bar{x} > 600$ from this distribution of sample means of size $2$.\n\nUse the conversion formula:\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{\\bar{x}-\\mu}{\\left(\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)}$$\n\n$$z = \\dfrac{(600-550)}{39.53}$$\n\n$$ = 1.26$$\n\nNow the problem becomes finding $\\text{P (z ≥ 1.26)}$.\n\nUsing the table of standard normal probabilities or a calculator, we find that the answer is $0.1038$, which rounds to $0.1$.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
