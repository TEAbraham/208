  "question_text": "A typical nurse's salary (in dollars) can range from $\\$25{,}000$ to $\\$55{,}000$ per year. A computer is programmed to randomly choose $20\\text{ nurse's salaries}$ from among the $200\\text{ nurses}$ employed at a hospital and compute the standard deviation.<br>The computer repeats this process a total of $50\\text{ times}$. The sampling distribution of the standard deviation of the nurse's salaries is shown below.<br><br><br><br><br>One of the points on this sampling distribution, $\\$8{,}165$, is highlighted.<br>What does this value represent?",
