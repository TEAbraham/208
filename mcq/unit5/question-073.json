  "question_text": "A typical nurse's salary (in dollars) can range from $\\$25{,}000$ to $\\$55{,}000$ per year.  A computer is programmed to randomly choose $20\\text{ nurse's salaries}$ from among the $200\\text{ nurses}$ employed at a hospital and compute the standard deviation. The computer repeats this process a total of $50\\text{ times}$ .  The sampling distribution of the standard deviation of the nurse's salaries is shown below. Created for Albert.io. Copyright 2017. All rights reserved. One of the points on this sampling distribution, $\\$8{,}165$ , is highlighted. What does this value represent?",
