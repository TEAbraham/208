  "question_text": "Chances are, since you are studying AP Statistics, you plan to earn at least a bachelor's degree from college. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, $29\\%$ of Americans age $25\\text{ years}$ or older have already earned a bachelor's or more advanced degree. You decide to randomly select $58\\text{ adults}$ over the age of $25$ to ask if they have earned at least a bachelor's degree.<br>Describe the sampling distribution of the proportion of respondents who have earned at least a bachelor's degree.",

  "solution": "When describing a distribution it is important to include three features:\n\nShape: The sampling distribution should be nearly normal as long as np≥10,n(1−p)≥10.\n\nIn this case:\n\nnp=(58)(0.29)\n\n=16.82≥10\n\n...and:\n\nn(1−p)=(58)(0.71)\n\n=41.18≥10\n\nIt is reasonable to expect the sampling distribution to be nearly normal.\n\nCenter: The mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the population proportion,0.29\n.\n\nSpread:\n\nσ\nˆ\np\n=\n√\np(1−p)\nn\n\n=\n√\n(0.29)(0.71)\n58\n\n=0.06\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoices 'B' and 'D' are incorrect. The standard deviation was incorrectly calculated as:\n\np\n(\n1\n−\np\n)\nn\n\n=\n0.29\n⋅\n(\n1\n−\n0.29\n)\n25\n\n=\n0.008\n\nChoices 'C' and 'E' are incorrect. The sampling distribution is nearly normal, and the student may have misinterpreted or miscalculated the conditions\nn\np\nor\nn\n(\n1\n−\np\n)\n.",
