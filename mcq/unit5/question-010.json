  "question_text": "The Spittles company claimed that there were $20\\%$ red candies in its fun-size packs and $20\\%$ red candies in its jumbo size bags. A test was run where the proportion of red candies in $80$ samples of each size type were to be recorded. What would the mean and standard deviation be for the sampling distribution for this difference in sample proportions?",
