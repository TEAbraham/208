  "solution": "Since the data in the sample comes from a population that is approximately normal, the sampling distribution will also be approximately normal. Small samples (n<10) will have a sampling distribution shape that resembles the parent population.\n\nIt is important to note that no population will be perfectly normal (or bell-shaped), but many populations of quantitative data can be modeled by the normal distribution.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
