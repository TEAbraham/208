  "question_text": "A statistics teacher collected data on the last digit of her $50$ studentsâ€™ home or cell phone numbers.<br>She remarked that the results were very similar to choosing $50$ digits from a random digits table. The mean $\\mu$ from this distribution was $4.5$, and the standard deviation $\\sigma$ was $2.87$.<br>She then had her students take all possible samples of size $4$ (a daunting task!) from the $50$ pieces of collected data and compute the mean for each sample. They graphed the sample means and calculated the new mean and standard deviation.<br>What did the graph look like, and what were the values of the new mean and standard deviation?",

  "solution": "The central limit theorem (CLT) tells us that the mean of sample means is the population mean, so the new mean is the same as the original $\\mu$ of $4.5$.\n\nThe CLT also states that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of means is obtained by dividing the population standard deviation by the square root of the sample size:\n\n$$\\text{Standard deviation}=\\dfrac{\\text{Population Standard Deviation}}{\\sqrt{\\text{sample size}}}$$\n\nThus, the new standard deviation is $\\dfrac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{ 4}} = \\dfrac{\\sigma}{2} = \\dfrac{2.87}{2} = 1.44$.\n\nThe shape of the new distribution will be a histogram that is unimodal and symmetric since the sample means will tend to cluster near the mean $\\mu$.\n\nWhile the new shape is approximately normal, it is technically still a histogram. If the population size were larger, and more samples of size n were taken, the resulting histogram would be essentially a smooth normal curve.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
