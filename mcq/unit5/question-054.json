  "question_text": "A statistics teacher collected data on the last digit of her $50$ studentsâ€™ home or cell phone numbers.\nShe remarked that the results were very similar to choosing $50$ digits from a random digits table. The mean $\\mu$ from this distribution was $4.5$, and the standard deviation $\\sigma$ was $2.87$.\nShe then had her students take all possible samples of size $4$ (a daunting task!) from the $50$ pieces of collected data and compute the mean for each sample. They graphed the sample means and calculated the new mean and standard deviation.\nWhat did the graph look like, and what were the values of the new mean and standard deviation?",
