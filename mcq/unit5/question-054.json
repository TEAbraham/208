The mean <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\mu$</span> from this distribution was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4.5$</span>, and the standard deviation <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\sigma$</span> was <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2.87$</span>.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">She then had her students take all possible samples of size <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$4$</span> (a daunting task!) from the <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$50$</span> pieces of collected data and compute the mean for each sample. They graphed the sample means and calculated the new mean and standard deviation.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What did the graph look like, and what were the values of the new mean and standard deviation?</div>",
