  "difficulty": "Medium",
  "question_text": "A survey conducted in Honeytown found that the average number of people per household was $4.3$ with a standard deviation of $1.2$. The true average size and standard deviation of a household in Honeytown is $4.1$ and $0.98$ respectively.<br>Using simple random samples of size $50$, what are the mean and standard deviation for the sampling distribution of the sample means of the number of people per household in Honeytown?",

  "solution": "Sampling distribution refers to the distribution of values taken by a statistic in all possible samples of the same size from the same population.\n\nFirst, let us find the mean of the sampling distribution of the sample means(${ \\mu }_{ \\overline { x } }$).\n\nThe formula which is given on the AP Exam is:\n\n$${ \\mu }_{ \\overline { x } }=\\mu $$\n\n...where $\\mu $ represents the population average.\n\nSo in this case,\n\n$${ \\mu }_{ \\overline { x } }=\\mu= 4.1$$\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E' can be eliminated.\n\nThe formula(also given on AP Exam) for the standard deviation for the sampling distribution of sample means is given by:\n\n$$\\sigma _{ \\overline { x } }=\\dfrac { \\sigma }{ \\sqrt { n } } $$\n\n...where $\\sigma $ represents the population standard deviation\n\nIn our case,\n\n$$\\sigma _{ \\overline { x } }=\\dfrac { 0.98 }{ \\sqrt { 50 } }$$\n\nChoice 'A' is our answer.",
