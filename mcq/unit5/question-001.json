  "question_text": "At a very large high school, the principal wanted to look at the number of male and female students taking advanced math courses. It was known that the average number has been $560$ girls and $520$ boys with standard deviations of $40$ and $45$ respectively. Random samples were drawn of $42$ girls and $38$ boys.\nWhat is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of this difference of sample means?",
