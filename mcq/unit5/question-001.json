It was known that the average number has been <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$560$</span> girls and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$520$</span> boys with standard deviations of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$45$</span> respectively.  Random samples were drawn of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$42$</span> girls and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$38$</span> boys.  What is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of this difference of sample means?</div>",
