The statistics teacher is going to take samples of $100$ random students and ask who they support for student body president. Which proportion is not a realistic answer if $52\\%$ of the school truly supports the candidate?",

  "solution": "If the proportion of the school that supports the candidate is truly 0.52 0.52 , this does not imply that every sample taken by the teacher will produce a proportion of students who support the candidate will always be 0.52 0.52 . This is due to the fact of sampling variability .\n\nTherefore, we do not know what each sample will produce as a proportion, but it is likely to be around 0.52 0.52 . Since all the options given are near 0.52 0.52 , all the options given are realistic proportions for each sample.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
