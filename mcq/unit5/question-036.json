The statistics teacher is going to take samples of $100$ random students and ask who they support for student body president.\nWhich proportion is not a realistic answer if $52\\%$ of the school truly supports the candidate?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "If the proportion of the school that supports the candidate is truly $0.52$, this does not imply that every sample taken by the teacher will produce a proportion of students who support the candidate will always be $0.52$. This is due to the fact of sampling variability.\n\nTherefore, we do not know what each sample will produce as a proportion, but it is likely to be around $0.52$. Since all the options given are near $0.52$, all the options given are realistic proportions for each sample.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
