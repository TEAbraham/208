  "solution": "Solution\n\nIf the proportion of the school that supports the candidate is truly 0.52\n, this does not imply that every sample taken by the teacher will produce a proportion of students who support the candidate will always be 0.52\n. This is due to the fact of sampling variability.\n\nTherefore, we do not know what each sample will produce as a proportion, but it is likely to be around 0.52\n. Since all the options given are near 0.52\n, all the options given are realistic proportions for each sample.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. Since 0.48\nis close to 0.52\n, it is a realistic proportion for a sample of 100\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. Since 0.50\nis close to 0.52\n, it is a realistic proportion for a sample of 100\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect. Since 0.52\nis equal to the proportion of the school that support the candidate, the sample could easily produce a proportion of 0.52\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. Since 0.54\nis close to 0.52\n, it is a realistic proportion for a sample of 100",
