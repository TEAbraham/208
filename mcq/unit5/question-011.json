Fizzy Cola has placed winning messages under <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$12\\%$</span> of its bottle caps.  Carbalicious has placed winning messages under <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$20\\%$</span> of its bottle caps.  A random sample of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$60$</span> Fizzy Cola bottles will be chosen and the proportion of winning bottle caps will be calculated.  The same will be done for <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$55$</span> randomly chosen bottles of Carbalicious.  The difference between these proportions will then be calculated.  </div><div class=\"paragraph\">What can be said about the sampling distribution of the difference in proportions of winning caps for the two sodas?</div>",
