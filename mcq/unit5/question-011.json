  "question_text": "Two soda companies are running a prize giveaway. Fizzy Cola has placed winning messages under $12\\%$ of its bottle caps. Carbalicious has placed winning messages under $20\\%$ of its bottle caps. A random sample of $60$ Fizzy Cola bottles will be chosen and the proportion of winning bottle caps will be calculated. The same will be done for $55$ randomly chosen bottles of Carbalicious. The difference between these proportions will then be calculated.<br>What can be said about the sampling distribution of the difference in proportions of winning caps for the two sodas?",

  "solution": "The sampling distribution of the differences in sample proportions should be nearly normal as long as n\\hat { p } \\ge 10 and n(1-\\hat { p } )\\ge 10.\n\n({ n }_{ F })({ p }_{ F })=(60)(0.12)=7.2\\ngeq 10\n({ n }_{ F })(1-{ p }_{ F })=(60)(0.88)=52.8\\ge 10\n({ n }_{ C })({ p }_{ C })=(55)(0.2)=11.0\\ge 10\n({ n }_{ C })(1-{ p }_{ C })=(55)(0.8)=44.0\\ge 10\n\nAs we can see, the first condition is not met, so it will not be nearly normal.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A': This choice only checks the nearly normal condition for one of the sodas. The condition must be met for both sodas.\n\nChoice 'B': This choice refers to the Central Limit Theorem which only applies to means, not proportions.\n\nChoices 'D' and 'E': Neither the true proportions nor the sample sizes need to be the same in order for a sampling distribution to be nearly normal.",
