  "solution": "When we take samples of the same size from the same population with a known mean there are a few characteristics that we know.

Meaning, that knowing the results from one sample does not affect the results of the other sample. \n\nAdditionally, we know that each random sample of size <span class=\"tex2jax_process\"><span class=\"MathJax_Preview\" style=\"color: inherit;\"></span><span id=\"MathJax-Element-16388-Frame\" class=\"mjx-chtml MathJax_CHTML\" tabindex=\"0\" data-mathml=\"<math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;><mi>n</mi></math>\" role=\"presentation\" style=\"font-size: 114%; position: relative;\"><span id=\"MJXc-Node-86152\" class=\"mjx-math\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span id=\"MJXc-Node-86153\" class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span id=\"MJXc-Node-86154\" class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.222em; padding-bottom: 0.277em;\">n</span></span></span></span><span class=\"MJX_Assistive_MathML\" role=\"presentation\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><mi>n</mi></math></span></span><script type=\"math/tex\" id=\"MathJax-Element-16388\">n</script></span> will produce a random value for the mean. This value will most likely be different from the known population mean, even though it could equal the population mean, and these values will often be different from each other. \n\nRegarding the shape, since we do not know how many students are in the class, we do not know the number of samples taken from the population. Additionally, since the population has unknown shape, we cannot say anything about the shape of the distribution of sample means. \n\nTherefore, only statements I and III are correct. \n\n<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is correct.

    "A": "<strong>Choice 'A'</strong> is incorrect. Statement I is correct, but it is not the only statement that is correct. ",
    "B": "<strong>Choice 'B'</strong> is incorrect. Since the shape is unknown, we cannot say the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal. Therefore, statement II is not correct. ",
