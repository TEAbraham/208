  "question_text": "The proportion of red oak trees on the west-facing slope of a 200\nacre forest is known to be pw=0.82\n. The east-facing slope has known proportion of pe=0.73\n. The numbers of trees per acre in this densely packed forest is 550\n. A research team tags a random sample of 56\ntrees from the west-facing slope and an additional random sample of 40\ntrees from the east-facing slope.<br>What is the probability that the difference between the proportion of red oaks in the west and east samples,\nˆ\np\nw−\nˆ\np\ne\n, is more than 25%\n?",
