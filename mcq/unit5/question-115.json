  "question_text": "The proportion of red oak trees on the west-facing slope of a 200 acre forest is known to be pw=0.82. The east-facing slope has known proportion of pe=0.73. The numbers of trees per acre in this densely packed forest is 550. A research team tags a random sample of 56 trees from the west-facing slope and an additional random sample of 40 trees from the east-facing slope.\nWhat is the probability that the difference between the proportion of red oaks in the west and east samples,\nˆ\np\nw−\nˆ\np\ne, is more than 25%?",
