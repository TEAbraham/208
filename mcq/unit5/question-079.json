  "question_text": "Jayla is trying to estimate the average GPA at her high school. Her counselor gives her an anonymous list of students and their GPA values. Jayla takes an initial sample of 25 students and finds a mean GPA of $2.45$. Jayla then decides to take a second sample to check her work, and selects a second sample of $25$ students. Jayla is surprised when the mean GPA for the second sample was $2.65$.\nWhat is the best explanation as to why the sample means for the average GPA at her high school were different?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When selecting samples of the same size, $n$, the samples will rarely result in statistics that are the same. This is the definition of sampling variability. Therefore, when taking samples of the same size, $n$, the sample means will most likely not be the same value.\n\nSo, Jayla, in fact did nothing wrong. The differences in the sample means are most likely due to the fact of sampling variability.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
