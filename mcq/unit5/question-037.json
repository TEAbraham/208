  "question_text": "A couple decides to go to an apple orchard to pick some apples. After searching the orchard for the best looking apples, they decide to pick $10$ apples from a single tree. When they go to pay, they figure out the average weight of each apple is $75$ grams. Can the couple speculate that the average size of the apples from the farm is $75$ grams?",

  "choices": [
    {
      "letter": "A",
      "text": "Yes, since they selected 10 10 apples, they can safely assume the average weight of all the apples on the farm is 75 75 grams."
    },
    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "Yes, because all samples of 10 10 apples will produce a mean weight of 75 75 grams."
    },
    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Yes,  since the apples are random, we can safely assume the mean will be 75 75 grams for all samples of size 10 10"
    },
    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "No, due to sampling variability, not all samples of size 10 10 will have a mean of 75 75 grams"

    {
      "letter": "E",
      "text": "No, because the Large Counts Condition is not met"
    }
  ],
  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "As stated in the problem, the couple selected a sample of 10 10 random apples from a tree. Due to the fact of Sampling Variability , not all samples of size 10 10 are guaranteed to have a mean of 75 75 grams. Some samples will produce a mean that is greater, while some will produce a mean that is less.\n\nTherefore, not all samples of size 10 10 will result in a mean weight of 75 75 grams.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
