  "question_text": "A couple decides to go to an apple orchard to pick some apples. After searching the orchard for the best looking apples, they decide to pick $10$ apples from a single tree. When they go to pay, they figure out the average weight of each apple is $75$ grams.\nCan the couple speculate that the average size of the apples from the farm is $75$ grams?",

    {
      "letter": "A",
      "text": "Yes, since they selected $10$ apples, they can safely assume the average weight of all the apples on the farm is $75$ grams."

    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "Yes, because all samples of $10$ apples will produce a mean weight of $75$ grams."

      "text": "No, due to sampling variability, not all samples of size $10$ will have a mean of $75$ grams"

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "As stated in the problem, the couple selected a sample of $10$ random apples from a tree. Due to the fact of Sampling Variability, not all samples of size $10$ are guaranteed to have a mean of $75$ grams. Some samples will produce a mean that is greater, while some will produce a mean that is less.\n\nTherefore, not all samples of size $10$ will result in a mean weight of $75$ grams.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct.",
