  "question_text": "While in college, Andrew ate chicken nuggets at least $5$ times per week. His average chicken nugget consumption in the colder months (October – March) was approximately symmetric with $\\mu_c=20$ and $\\sigma_c=2$. During the warmer months (April-September), his average chicken nugget consumption was approximately symmetric with $\\mu_w=15$ and $\\sigma_w=3$.\nA random sample of $30$ meals from the cold months and $45$ meals from the warm months was analyzed. Let $\\bar{x}_c-\\bar{x}_w$ be the difference in the sample mean amount of chicken nuggets consumed during the cold and warm months.\nWhat is the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference in average nuggets per meal in the cold and warm months for Andrew?",
