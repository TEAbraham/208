  "question_text": "There has been a tradition of pumpkin growing contests in both the East and West Coasts with thousands of pumpkins being entered.  In the past, the average entered pumpkin on the East Coast weighed $360$ pounds with a standard deviation of $60$ pounds. The average pumpkin entered on the West Coast weighed $340$ pounds. This year, random samples of $36$ pumpkins were taken on the East Coast and $24$ pumpkins on the West Coast (both coasts' pumpkins were shown to be normally distributed). Given that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference of sample means is $14$ , find the standard deviation of the pumpkins on the west coast.",
