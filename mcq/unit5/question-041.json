The average pumpkin entered on the West Coast weighed <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$340$</span> pounds.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">This year, random samples of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$36$</span> pumpkins were taken on the East Coast and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$24$</span> pumpkins on the West Coast (both coasts' pumpkins were shown to be normally distributed). Given that the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the difference of sample means is <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$14$</span>, find the standard deviation of the pumpkins on the west coast.</div>",
