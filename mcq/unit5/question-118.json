  "question_text": "At Taylor Farms, chickens are free-range and happily produce over $25$ eggs per day. Ms. Taylor weighs each egg that her chickens lay and records the data in a spreadsheet. Over the past five years, she has collected and weighed $40{,}000$ eggs. A random selection of $12$ eggs is gathered for the local farmers market each Friday.<br>Under which circumstance can Taylor assume that the sampling distribution of average weight of a sample of $12$ eggs is approximately Normal?",

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nSince the sample size is small ($n=12<30$), the Large Counts Condition is not satisfied. Therefore, it is required that the samples of $12$ eggs come from a population that is approximately Normal in order for the sampling distribution to be approximately Normal.\n\nSo, Choice 'A' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect.\n\nSince the sample size is small (n=12<30), the Large Counts Condition is not satisfied. Therefore, if the population was skewed left, we can expect the sampling distribution to also be skewed left, and thus, not Normal.\n\nChoice 'C' is **incorrect.\n\nSince the sample size is small (n=12<30), the Large Counts Condition is not satisfied. Therefore, if the population was skewed right, we can expect the sampling distribution to also be skewed right, and thus, not Normal.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect.\n\nSince the sample size is small (n=12<30), the Large Counts Condition is not satisfied. Therefore, we can expect the sampling distribution to also be skewed in the direction consistent with the population, and thus, not Normal.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect.\n\nSince the sample size is small (n=12<30\n), the Large Counts Condition is not satisfied. The only condition under which the sampling distribution of mean egg weight is approximately Normal is if the population from which it was drawn is also approximately Normal. We can expect the sampling distribution to also be skewed in the direction consistent with the population, and thus, not Normal.",
