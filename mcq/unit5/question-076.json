The orange candies are normally distributed and have a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$6$</span> candies.  If you sampled a number of these bags and found between <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$225$</span> and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$250$</span> orange pieces, how would you write this interval as a probability?</div>",
