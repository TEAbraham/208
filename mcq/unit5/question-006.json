  "question_text": "A consumer research organization was interested in determining the mean number of credit cards owned by adults living in Kansas. To investigate, surveys were mailed to a random sample of $500$ adults with a Kansas address. However, only $84$ adults actually answered and returned the survey.\nGiven the following facts:\nThe population parameter is known to be $2.8$ credit cards.\nThe sample mean was found to be $2.9$ credit cards.\nThe standard deviation, $\\sigma$ is $0.7$ credit cards.\nDescribe the sampling distribution of $\\bar{x}$.",
