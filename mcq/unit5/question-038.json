  "question_text": "Two friends are playing a board game. One friend decides to find the mean of the sum of his last three rolls. His $3$ rolls are shown below: $3$ Rolls: $8, 7, 6$ for a mean sum of $7$ . Is this friend's next three rolls guaranteed to be equal to $7$ ?",

    {
      "letter": "A",
      "text": "No, because rolling 2 2 dice produces random sums"
    },
    {
      "letter": "B",
      "text": "No, because 8 , 7 8 , 7 & 6 6 have been rolled and can't be rolled again"
    },
    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "No, because a sum of 7 7 has a probability of 1 6 1 6 , so it won't happen for 5 5 more turns"
    },
    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "Yes, because the mean will always be 7 7 as it's the most likely outcome"
    },
    {
      "letter": "E",
      "text": "Yes, because we divide by 3 3 the mean will always be 7 7"
    }
  ],
  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Since rolling two dice represent a chance model, the sum produced when rolling two dice will be random on each turn. For example, since each number on each die has a 1 6 1 6 probability of showing on each roll, each sum has it's own probability. Therefore the sums will not always average out to be 7 7 .\n\nThe players next roll is not guaranteed to have an average of 7 7 , and in fact can be any number from 2 − 12 2 − 12 .\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
