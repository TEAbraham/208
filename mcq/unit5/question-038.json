  "question_text": "Two friends are playing a board game. One friend decides to find the mean of the sum of his last three rolls. His $3$ rolls are shown below:\n$3$ Rolls: $8, 7, 6$ for a mean sum of $7$.\nIs this friend's next three rolls guaranteed to be equal to $7$?",

      "letter": "B",
      "text": "No, because $8, 7$ & $6$ have been rolled and can't be rolled again"

    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "No, because a sum of $7$ has a probability of $\\frac{1}{6}$, so it won't happen for $5$ more turns"

    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "Yes, because the mean will always be $7$ as it's the most likely outcome"

    {
      "letter": "E",
      "text": "Yes, because we divide by $3$ the mean will always be $7$"
    }

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'A' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Since rolling two dice represent a chance model, the sum produced when rolling two dice will be random on each turn. For example, since each number on each die has a $\\frac{1}{6}$ probability of showing on each roll, each sum has it's own probability. Therefore the sums will not always average out to be $7$.\n\nThe players next roll is not guaranteed to have an average of $7$, and in fact can be any number from $2-12$.\n\nChoice 'A' is correct.",
