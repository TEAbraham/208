  "question_text": "How could one determine if the distribution of sample means is approximately normal?<br>I. Both $np$ and $n (1-p)$ are greater than $10$, where $n$ is the number of trials and $p$ is the proportion of success.<br>II. The sample is large, say greater than $30$.<br>III. The parent population is approximately normal.",

  "solution": "Statement I is incorrect; this condition involves sample proportions to be approximately normal, not sample means.\n\nStatement II is correct; the central limit theorem ensures approximate normality if the sample is large enough.\n\nStatement III is correct; if the parent population is normal, the sampling distribution will be approximately normal no matter the sample size.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
