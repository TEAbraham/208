Bix cereal claimed that <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$22\\%$</span> of their boxes contained winning cards and Bops cereal claimed that <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$20\\%$</span> of their boxes contained winning cards.  In an attempt to test this, a consumer goods company purchased <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> boxes of Bix and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$38$</span> boxes of Bops cereals.
