  "question_text": "Golf darts are played in a large field that has several targets made out of net. If the player hits the ball and it lands in one of the nets, the player scores points and the golf ball is automatically sent back to the player through an underground tunnel system. If the golf ball does not land in the net, it stays on the field where it is later picked up by a tractor system.<br>Suppose the true proportion of golf balls that land on the field each day is $60\\%$.\nWhat are the mean and standard deviation of the sample proportion of golf balls that land on the field when samples of $100$ golf balls are shot?<br>What are the mean and standard deviation of the sample proportion of golf balls that land on the field when samples of $100$ golf balls are shot?",

  "solution": "The mean of the sampling distribution equals the true population proportion, $0.6$. We would expect most of the sample proportions to be close to $0.6$.\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution can be found by:\n\nσ\nˆ\np\n=\n√\np(1−p)\nn\n=\n√\n(0.6)(0.4)\n100\n=0.049\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nThe proportion must be between 0 and 1. Choices 'C' and 'D' are incorrect.\n\nChoices 'A' and 'E' are incorrect and incorrectly calculate the standard deviation.",
