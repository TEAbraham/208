Suppose $85\\%$ of the clients at Sandra's Hair Salon are completely satisfied with their salon service.<br>What are the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the proportion of clients who are completely satisfied with their salon service when $25\\text{ customers}$ are sampled?",

  "solution": "The mean of the sampling distribution equals the true population proportion, $0.85$. We would expect most of the sample proportions to be close to $0.85$.\n\nThe standard deviation of the sampling distribution can be found by:\n\nσ\nˆ\np\n=\n√\np(1−p)\nn\n\n=\n√\n(0.85)(0.15)\n25\n\nRemember, that this formula is provided on the exam!\n\nThe other answer choices incorrectly use the formula to determine standard deviation of sample proportion.",
