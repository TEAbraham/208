  "solution": "When describing a distribution it is important to include three features:\n\nShape: Because the sample size is only\n15\n, the Central Limit Theorem will not apply. Since the population is skewed right, the sampling distribution will also be skewed right.\n\nCenter: The mean of the sampling distribution is the same as the population mean.\n\nSpread:\n\nσ\n¯¯¯\nx\n=\nσ\n√\nn\n\n=\n354,429\n√\n15\n\n=\n91,513\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect. We cannot assume that the sample standard deviation is the same as the population standard deviation.\n\nChoices 'C', 'D', and 'E' are incorrect. These represent nearly normal distributions, which are incorrect.",
