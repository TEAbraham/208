  "question_text": "A large pond in rural Vermont with thousands of fish has an established proportion of $ 40 \\%$ native brown trout. April of $2019$ brought severe weather with tornadoes and massive flash floods, during which much of the natural features in the area were disturbed. Wes, the local game warden, was put in charge of sampling ponds in the area for native brown trout.\nWhich of the following statements is NOT true?",
