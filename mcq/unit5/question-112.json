  "solution": "Solution\n\nThe sampling distribution of\nˆ\np\nhas the following properties: μ\nˆ\np\n=p, σ\nˆ\np\n=\n√\n(p)(1−p)\nn\n, the distribution is approximately Normal when the sample size, n, is large by the following conditions: np≥10 and n(1−p)≥10.\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect. This answer contains the correct mean and standard deviation, but the description of the shape is incorrect.\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect. This choice states the 10\n% condition is violated when in fact, it is not. The 10\n% condition verifies values in the sample are independent from each other when the sample is taken from a large population. The population here is given as large.\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect. This choice also states the 10\n% condition is violated, but, as discussed above, the population is large enough. Also, this statement describes the shape incorrectly.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect. This choice states the mean cannot be calculated but it can: μ\nˆ\np\n=0.52\n.",
