  "question_text": "The number of pets per household in a large city varies with mean $1.4$ and standard deviation $1.0$. Because a household cannot have a fraction of a pet, the population distribution cannot be Normal. The city animal control officer inspects $100$ apartments and calculates $\\bar{x}$. What is the mean and standard deviation for the sampling distribution of average number of pets in samples of size $n=100$?",
