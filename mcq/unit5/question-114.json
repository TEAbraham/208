  "question_text": "Two hatchery trucks, each carrying $600$ trout (trout is a type of fish), arrive at a trout stocking location. Truck A has $28\\%$ golden trout while truck B has $22\\%$ golden trout. Because the fish are in holding tanks with rapidly moving water, each release can be considered a random sample of fish.\nTruck A releases fish in groups of $40$ fish while truck B releases fish in groups of $50$ fish. An avid angler counts the number of golden trout in the first release from each truck and computes the difference in their sample proportions, $\\hat{p}_A-\\hat{p}_B$.\nWhat is the approximate mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}_A-\\hat{p}_B$?",
