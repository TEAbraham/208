Truck A has <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$28\\%$</span> golden trout while truck B has <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$22\\%$</span> golden trout.  Because the fish are in holding tanks with rapidly moving water, each release can be considered a random sample of fish. </div><div class=\"paragraph\">Truck A releases fish in groups of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> fish while truck B releases fish in groups of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$50$</span> fish.  An avid angler counts the number of golden trout in the first release from each truck and computes the difference in their sample proportions, <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\hat{p}_A-\\hat{p}_B$</span>.</div><div class=\"paragraph\">What is the approximate mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$\\hat{p}_A-\\hat{p}_B$</span>?</div>",
