  "question_text": "Two hatchery trucks, each carrying $600$ trout (trout is a type of fish), arrive at a trout stocking location. Truck A has $28\\%$ golden trout while truck B has $22\\%$ golden trout. Because the fish are in holding tanks with rapidly moving water, each release can be considered a random sample of fish.<br>Truck A releases fish in groups of $40$ fish while truck B releases fish in groups of $50$ fish. An avid angler counts the number of golden trout in the first release from each truck and computes the difference in their sample proportions, $\\hat{p}_A-\\hat{p}_B$.<br>What is the approximate mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution of $\\hat{p}_A-\\hat{p}_B$?",

  "correct_answer": "Correct Answer",
  "solution": "Choice ‘B’ is the correct answer.\n\nSolution\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions is the difference in the population proportions. That is to say:\n\nμ\nˆ\np\nA−\nˆ\np\nB=pA−pB=0.28−0.22=0.06\n\nBecause there are at least 10(40)=400 trout in truck A and 10(50)=500 trout in truck B, the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of difference in sample proportions is:\n\nσ\nˆ\np\nA−\nˆ\np\nB=\n√\n(0.28)(0.72)\n40\n+\n(0.22)(0.78)\n50\n≈0.092\n\nSo, Choice 'B' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice ‘A’ is incorrect.\n\nThough the mean of the sampling distribution of difference of sample proportions is computed correctly, the variance was given instead of standard deviation.\nσ\n2\nˆ\np\nA−\nˆ\np\nB\n=\n(0.28)(0.72)\n40\n+\n(0.22)(0.78)\n50\n≈0.008\n\nChoice ‘C’ is incorrect.\n\nThough the mean of the sampling distribution of difference of sample proportions is computed correctly, the standard deviation was found by subtracting the variances. Remember that variation increases when samples are combined, regardless of whether the samples are added or subtracted.\n\nCorrect Work:\n\nσ\n^\np\nA\n−\n^\np\nB\n=\n√\n(\np\nA\n)\n(\n1\n−\np\nA\n)\nn\nA\n+\n(\np\nB\n)\n(\n1\n−\np\nB\n)\nn\nB\n\nIncorrect Work:\n\nσ\n^\np\nA\n−\n^\np\nB\n=\n√\n(\np\nA\n)\n(\n1\n−\np\nA\n)\nn\nA\n−\n(\np\nB\n)\n(\n1\n−\np\nB\n)\nn\nB\n\nChoice ‘D’ is incorrect.\n\nThough the mean of the sampling distribution of difference of sample proportions is computed correctly, an incorrect calculation of variance was given. This was found by subtracting the variances from each sample, and then NOT taking the square root. Remember that variation increases when samples are combined, regardless of whether the samples are added or subtracted.\n\nChoice ‘E’ is incorrect.\n\nThough the standard deviation of the sampling distribution of differences in sample proportions is computed correctly, the mean of the sampling distribution of the difference in sample proportions is incorrect. The sum of proportions was found by adding\np\nA\nto\np\nB\n.",
