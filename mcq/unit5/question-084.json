It has been found that the first assembly line fills the bags with an average of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$398$</span> candies with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$6$</span> candies. The other assembly line fills bags with an average of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$401$</span> candies with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$8$</span> candies.  Suppose <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$36$</span> bags are randomly sampled from the first assembly line and <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$32$</span> bags are randomly sampled from the second assembly line.  What is the probability of finding that the bags from the two assembly lines differ by more than a total of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$5$</span> candies?</div>",
