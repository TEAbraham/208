  "question_text": "The company which makes the very popular N & N Candies has two assembly lines that fill jumbo bags with what is supposed to be $400$ candies. It has been found that the first assembly line fills the bags with an average of $398$ candies with a standard deviation of $6$ candies. The other assembly line fills bags with an average of $401$ candies with a standard deviation of $8$ candies. Suppose $36$ bags are randomly sampled from the first assembly line and $32$ bags are randomly sampled from the second assembly line.\nWhat is the probability of finding that the bags from the two assembly lines differ by more than a total of $5$ candies?",
