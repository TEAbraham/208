  "question_text": "Suppose at a large high school, the average AP test score for AP Statistics is $2.84$ with a standard deviation of $0.45$.\nThe school decided to offer nightly study sessions and randomly chose $30$ students to participate. These $30$ students averaged AP scores of $3.1$.\nWhat can be said about the effectiveness of the AP study sessions?",
