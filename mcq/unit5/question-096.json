  "question_text": "A standard deck of playing cards is made up of $26\\text{ red cards}$ and $26\\text{ black cards}$. Robbie obtains $5$ identical decks of cards. He shuffles and deals a card and records its color. He replaces the card in the deck and repeats this process $25\\text{ times}$, obtaining $10\\text{ red cards}$ and $15\\text{ black cards}$ - only $40\\%$ red!<br>Robbie wonders if the stack of cards has an unusually small proportion of red cards.<br>What is the probability of obtaining a sample proportion less than or equal to $0.4$?",

  "solution": "Since this question asks about the likelihood of a sample proportion, first consider if it is appropriate to use the normal model.\n\nSince:\n\nnp=(25)(0.5)\n\n=12.5≥10\n\n\nn(1−p)=(25)(0.5)\n\n=12.5≥10\n\n...the sampling distribution should be nearly normal. Choice 'E' is incorrect.\n\nThe sampling distribution will have a mean of 0.5 and a standard deviation of\n\nσ\nˆ\np\n=\n√\np(1−p)\nn\n\n=\n√\n(0.5)(0.5)\n25\n\n=0.1\n\nFind the z\n-score:\n\nz=\n0.4−0.5\n0.1\n\n=−1\n\nOn your calculator:\n\nnormalcdf(-99,-1,0,1) =0.16\n\nYou may also use the z\n-score table to convert the z\n-score of −1\nto a percent.\n\nA 16%\nprobability is not too low, so there is little reason to believe the deck has an unusually small proportion of red cards.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect. This represents an incorrect calculation using incorrect sample size n=10\ninstead of n=25\n. This is then used to calculate a z\n-score of approximately −0.64\n, with a p\n-value of 0.26\n.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect and represents the complement of the probability in Choice 'B'.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect. This is the complement of the calculated probability 0.16\n, or the probability of z=1\ninstead of z=−1\n.",
