  "question_text": "A standard deck of playing cards is made up of $26\\text{ red cards}$ and $26\\text{ black cards}$. Robbie obtains $5$ identical decks of cards. He shuffles and deals a card and records its color. He replaces the card in the deck and repeats this process $25\\text{ times}$, obtaining $10\\text{ red cards}$ and $15\\text{ black cards}$ - only $40\\%$ red!\nRobbie wonders if the stack of cards has an unusually small proportion of red cards.\nWhat is the probability of obtaining a sample proportion less than or equal to $0.4$?",
