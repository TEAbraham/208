  "solution": "Estimators must have low bias and low variability. Low bias in a sampling distribution is defined as the mean of the sampling distribution being equal to the true population mean. Low variability in this situation is based on a low standard deviation.\n\nChoice 'D' is correct; it is the only solution that has no bias and also has the lowest variability since the standard deviation is only 4%.",
