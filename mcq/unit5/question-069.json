  "question_text": "When using normal calculations involving sampling proportions, which of the conditions must be met?<br><br>I. The population must be at least $10$ times the sample.<br>II. $np$ and $n (1-p)$ must both be greater than or equal to $10$, where $n$ is the sample size and $p$ is the proportion of success.<br>III. The sample size must be over $30$.",

  "solution": "Statement I is true; the population must be at least $10$ times the sample to use the standard deviation formula for proportions.\n\nStatement II is true; these conditions must be met for the distribution to be approximately normal, and the distribution has to be approximately normal to do any calculations using the standard normal table.\n\nStatement III is false; this is only a condition for sample means, not proportions.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'D'.",
