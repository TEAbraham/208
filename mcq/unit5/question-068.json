  "solution": "When asked to give the sampling distribution, the main features that should be expressed are shape, center, and spread. For sampling distributions, the best measure of center is mean, and best measure of spread is standard deviation.\n\nThe shape will be approximately normal since np and n(\n1\n-p) are both more than\n10\n, as\nn\n=\n60\nand\np\n=\n0.64\n.\n\nThe center will be the mean of all the sample proportions, which is equal to the true population mean =\n0.64\n.\n\nThe standard deviation will be\n0.06197\nbased off the formula below, using\nn\n=\n60\n, and\np\n=\n0.64\n:\n\n√\np\n(\n1\n−\np\n)\nn\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
