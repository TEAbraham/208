In this year’s survey, $56$ out of $115$ randomly chosen subjects felt financially comfortable.<br>If indeed the residents’ economic opinions have not changed from last year, what’s the probability of getting a survey of size $n = 115$, where $56$ or fewer subjects say they feel financially comfortable?",
