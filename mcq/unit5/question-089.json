  "question_text": "A statistics teacher collected data on the last digit of her $50$ students’ home or cell phone numbers. She remarked that the results were very similar to choosing $50$ digits from a random digits table.<br>What would the distribution of the last digit of the $50$ students’ phone numbers look like, and what would you expect the mean to be?",

  "solution": "First, calculate the mean. Since digits from a random numbers table are relatively evenly distributed, it would be logical to assume that there were, on average, five students whose last phone digit was each of the\n1\n-digit numbers from the random numbers table.\n\nTherefore, the mean of these digits will be:\n\n5\n×\n0\n+\n5\n×\n1\n+\n5\n×\n2\n+\n5\n×\n3\n+\n5\n×\n4\n+\n5\n×\n5\n+\n5\n×\n6\n+\n5\n×\n7\n+\n5\n×\n8\n+\n5\n×\n9\n\n...divided by the number of students,\n50\n. The arithmetic yields\n225\n50\n=\n4.5\n=\nμ\n.\n\nThe shape of the distribution will be flat, with no humps, since each digit is equally likely. This flat shape is called a uniform distribution.\n\nIt will be a discrete uniform distribution since only whole number digits can be possible answers, unlike a continuous uniform distribution, which has a flat shape, but there is an infinite number of possible values, such as\n1.28\nor\n3.32227\n.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
