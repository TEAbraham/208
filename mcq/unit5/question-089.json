  "question_text": "A statistics teacher collected data on the last digit of her $50$ students’ home or cell phone numbers. She remarked that the results were very similar to choosing $50$ digits from a random digits table. What would the distribution of the last digit of the $50$ students’ phone numbers look like, and what would you expect the mean to be?",
