The data from all students over the last $10\\text{ years}$ is given in the following table:<br>The university recently started an initiative to encourage students to find higher-paying summer jobs in line with their potential careers. A random sample of $30\\text{ males}$ found a mean summer income of $\\$3{,}804$ with a standard deviation of $\\$1{,}240$.<br>Assuming females have the same standard deviation as before ($\\$984$), how large of a sample mean would the female sample of size $30$ have to be in order to claim that females have benefited just as much as males from this initiative?",
