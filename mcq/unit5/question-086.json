  "question_text": "A local university is interested in summer earnings of its students. The data from all students over the last $10\\text{ years}$ is given in the following table: Males Females Mean $ 3,201 $ 2,401 St. Dev. $ 1,231 $ 984 The university recently started an initiative to encourage students to find higher-paying summer jobs in line with their potential careers. A random sample of $30\\text{ males}$ found a mean summer income of $\\$3{,}804$ with a standard deviation of $\\$1{,}240$ . Assuming females have the same standard deviation as before ( $\\$984$ ), how large of a sample mean would the female sample of size $30$ have to be in order to claim that females have benefited just as much as males from this initiative?",
