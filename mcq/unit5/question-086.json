The data from all students over the last $10\\text{ years}$ is given in the following table:<br>The university recently started an initiative to encourage students to find higher-paying summer jobs in line with their potential careers. A random sample of $30\\text{ males}$ found a mean summer income of $\\$3{,}804$ with a standard deviation of $\\$1{,}240$.<br>Assuming females have the same standard deviation as before ($\\$984$), how large of a sample mean would the female sample of size $30$ have to be in order to claim that females have benefited just as much as males from this initiative?",

  "solution": "First, find how many standard deviations above the mean the males are.\n\nThe $z$-score for males is:\n\n$$\\dfrac{(3804-3201)}{\\left(\\dfrac{1240}{\\sqrt{30}}\\right)} = 2.66$$\n\nNext, set up the following equation for females:\n\n$$2.66 =\\dfrac{ (x-2401)}{\\left(\\dfrac{984}{\\sqrt{30}}\\right)}$$\n\nNow solve for $x$:\n\n(\n984\n√\n30\n)2.66=\n(x−2401)\n(\n984\n√\n30\n)\n(\n984\n√\n30\n)\n\nx=(\n984\n√\n30\n)2.66+2401\n\nx=2878.88\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.\n\nThe sample of 30 females must earn an average of $2,878.88 to claim that females have benefited as much as males from this initiative.",
