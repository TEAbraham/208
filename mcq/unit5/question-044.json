  "solution": "To describe the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means, we analyze its shape, center, and spread.\n\nThe Central Limit Theorem (CLT) states that the sampling distribution of the difference in means will be approximately normal if each sample size is large enough (typically n≥30\n) or if the population distributions are normal.\n\nA common mistake is to add the two sample sizes together (i.e., 20+21=41\n) and assume that because the total is above 30\nor 40\n, the sampling distribution is normal. However, this is incorrect because: - The CLT applies to each individual sample separately, not to their combined total. - If either sample is small and comes from a non-normal population, the sampling distribution may not be normal. - Since both sample sizes are under 30\n, normality depends entirely on the population distributions, which we do not know.\n\nThus, the shape of the sampling distribution is unable to be determined.\n\nThe mean of the sampling distribution of the difference in sample means is:\n\nμ\nˉ\nx\nU−\nˉ\nx\nR=μU−μR\n\nSince we do not know the population means, we estimate this using the sample means:\n\nˆ\nμ\nˉ\nx\nU−\nˉ\nx\nR=126.1−128.8=−2.7\n\nThis means, on average, the urban weights are\n2.7\npounds lower than the rural weights in the sample.\n\nThe standard deviation (standard error) of the sampling distribution is given by the formula:\n\nS\nE\n¯\nx\nU\n−\n¯\nx\nR\n=\n√\nσ\n2\nU\nn\nU\n+\nσ\n2\nR\nn\nR\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\nS\nE\n¯\nx\nU\n−\n¯\nx\nR\n=\n√\n10.5\n2\n20\n+\n13.2\n2\n21\n\n=\n√\n110.25\n20\n+\n174.24\n21\n\n=\n√\n5.5125\n+\n8.2962\n\n=\n√\n13.8087\n≈\n3.72\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'E'.",
