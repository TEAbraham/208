  "question_text": "In a certain year, a test's scores had a mean $µ$ of $18$ and a standard deviation of $6$.<br>If a simple random sample of $36$ students were chosen, what would be the mean and standard deviation of the sampling distribution from which the sample was taken?",

  "solution": "The mean μ of the sampling distribution is the mean of the original distribution.\n\nThe standard deviation is smaller, with formula:\n\nStandard deviation=\nσ\n√\nn\n\n...where σ is the standard deviation and n is the sample size.\n\nThis becomes\n6\n√\n36\n=\n6\n6\n=1\n.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'C'.",
