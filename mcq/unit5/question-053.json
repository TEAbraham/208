One day, the manager is surprised to see the next $5$ randomly selected receipts averaged $\\$150$ . The next day, the manager was even more surprised to see the next $5$ randomly selected receipts were each greater than $\\$150$ . Use the probability of each event to find which occurrence is more surprising.",
