    "A": "<strong>Choice 'A'</strong> is incorrect. When selecting random samples,  a sample mean that is equal to the know population mean is entirely possible and does not mean the sample was not random. ",

    "C": "<strong>Choice 'C'</strong> is incorrect.  When selecting random samples, a sample mean can be equal to a value that is not the population mean, but this does not imply the sample was more random. ",
    "D": "<strong>Choice 'D'</strong> is incorrect. When selecting random samples, a sample mean that is not a whole number is entirely possible and does not imply that it was not random."
