  "difficulty": "Moderate",
  "question_text": "Two students are working on a project in AP Statistics. The students are taking random samples of size $n = 100$ from a population with a known mean of $\\mu = 10$ . The students sample means are given below: Student Mean $1$ $\\mu_1 = 9.5$ $2$ $\\mu_2 = 10$ Each student is claiming their sample was \"more random\". Which student is correct?",

      "text": "Both sample were equally random because different samples taken from the sample population can be different"

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'E' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "When selecting a sample from a population, with or without a known population mean, it is important to remember that differences between the samples can exist. This idea is called sampling variability . All sample of size 100 100 will not produce the same sample mean.\n\nTherefore, since both students took random samples of size 100 100 , both of the samples would be considered equally \"random\", even if one sample produced the a sample mean that was equal to the population mean.\n\nChoice 'E' is correct.",
