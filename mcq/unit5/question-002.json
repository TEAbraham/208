  "question_text": "A large grocery store chain regularly receives shipments of potatoes from two main suppliers. The Potent Potato Company sends potatoes that come in sacks that weigh an average of $6.2$ pounds with a standard deviation of $2.8$ pounds. The Portly Potato Company sends sacks of potatoes that weigh an average of $5.7$ pounds with a standard deviation of $3.1$ pounds. The grocery store wants to compare the potatoes coming from the two companies so a random sample of $24$ potato sacks was taken from Potent Potato and a random sample of $32$ sacks was taken from Portly Potato.<br>Could the analyst then proceed to find the probability that the potato sacks from one company weigh more than the potato sacks from the other company? Why?",

      "letter": "B",
      "text": "Yes.\nWe can because both samples are random samples."

    {
      "letter": "C",
      "text": "Yes.\nWe checked it out with both the Potent and Portly Potato companies and found that the sample numbers were less than $10\\%$ of the population size."
    },
    {
      "letter": "D",
      "text": "No.\nSince we know that both sample sizes must be greater than or equal to $30$, and that of Potent Potato was only $24$, we cannot continue with our calculations."

      "letter": "E",
      "text": "No.\nWe needed to be given the parameters for the differences of the sampling distributions."

  "correct_answer": "Choice 'D' is the correct answer.",
  "solution": "Solution\n\nTo determine probabilities for the sampling distribution for the difference of two means, we must show that the sampling distribution can be modelled by a normal distribution. Two conditions for this are: to either have the knowledge that the two distributions are normally distributed or to know that both sample sizes are of size 30 or larger.\n\nWhile it is standard to take samples that are smaller than 10% of the population, that is not always essential, though it may lower the value of the standard deviation.\n\nThis last piece of information is irrelevant here, for this problem contains a sample size of 24, clearly less than 30, so that is enough information to tell us, no, we cannot show normality and calculate probabilities.\n\nSo, Choice 'D' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect because both samples must be of size 30\nor larger.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because this is not enough information to make this decision.\n\nChoice 'C' is incorrect because this information is irrelevant as one sample size is not large enough.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because , while it correctly answers 'no,' we do have enough information to calculate our parameters.",
