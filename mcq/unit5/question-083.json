Assembly line <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$1$</span> had a mean container weight of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$15.8$</span> ounces with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.6$</span> ounces.  Assembly line <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$2$</span> had a mean container weight of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$16.1$</span> ounces with a standard deviation of <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.7$</span> ounces.  If <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$40$</span> containers are to be sampled from each assembly line, what is the probability that the weights do not differ by more than <span class=\"tex2jax_process\">$0.1$</span> ounce in either direction?  Round your answer to the nearest percent.</div>",
