  "question_text": "An ice cream company ran two assembly lines for two of its most popular flavors. Assembly line $1$ had a mean container weight of $15.8$ ounces with a standard deviation of $0.6$ ounces. Assembly line $2$ had a mean container weight of $16.1$ ounces with a standard deviation of $0.7$ ounces. If $40$ containers are to be sampled from each assembly line, what is the probability that the weights do not differ by more than $0.1$ ounce in either direction? Round your answer to the nearest percent.",
