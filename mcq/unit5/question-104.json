  "solution": "Solution\n\nSince height is recognized as being normally distributed, we can use it as a continuous random variable to solve for a probability or proportion. We solve this problem using the formula:\n\nz=\nˉ\nx\n−μ\nσ\n\n...where z represents the z-score,\nˉ\nx\nrepresents the statistic in the problem, μ represents the mean of the population, and σ represents the standard deviation of the population.\n\nIn this problem, we first must find the value of z based on the given percentile. Since we are given the 4th percentile, we look up the decimal 0.04 in the body of Table A to find the corresponding z-score of −1.75. Note that we actually see 0.0401 in the table but that is very close!\n\nThen we plug in the given values of 64\n, the statistic, for\nˉ\nx\nand the given population mean of 69.1\nfor μ\nto obtain this equation:\n\n−1.75=\n64−69.1\nσ\n\nSolving for σ\nwe find that it equals 2.9\n.\n\nSo, Choice 'C' is correct.\n\nExplanation of Distractors\n\nChoice 'A' is incorrect, mostly, because a standard deviation cannot be negative.\n\nChoice 'B' is incorrect because the equation was set equal to 4\n(for the 4\nth percentile) instead of the z\n-score.\n\nChoice 'D' is incorrect because it is wrong and could represent an arithmetic error.\n\nChoice 'E' is incorrect because this answer uses the variance instead of the standard deviation.",
