Mr. Jones found the average grade in his biology class ($n = 30$) was $80.2$. This compares to the school-wide average of $77.3$.<br>Which of the value is a statistic and which is a parameter?",

  "solution": "A statistic describes a sample, while parameter describes the population.\n\nFor example, if I sample 100 random people in the United States and find that 46% plan to vote Republican in the next election, the value\n46\n100\n=0.46 is a statistic.\n\nThe unknown percentage who actually do vote Republican on election day is a parameter because this value describes the population. Note, the population is defined as who we want information about.\n\nIn this particular problem, Mr. Jones's class of size n=30\nis a sample, and ALL students who take biology at the school is the population. Therefore, the score of 80.2\nis a statistic since it describes the sample, while the score of 77.3\nis a parameter because it describes the population.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'A'.",
