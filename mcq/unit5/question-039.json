  "solution": "Statements I and III are false; statistically significant does not imply the importance or meaningfulness of results, nor does it imply how the data was gathered.\n\nStatement II is true; statistically significant means that something is unlikely to happen by chance.\n\nThus, the correct answer is Choice 'B'.",
